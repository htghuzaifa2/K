      <p>(and the ripple-effects they left on the finished films)</p>
      <h3>1. Avengers: Endgame (2019) – The 5-Minute Cam-rip Heard ’Round the World</h3>
      <p><strong>What dropped:</strong> A full 5-minute cam-rip showing Hulk in the quantum suit, time-heist planning, and Tony’s “I am Iron Man” death scene.</p>
      <p><strong>When:</strong> 10 days before global release.</p>
      <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Disney accelerated the world premiere by 4 days, added extra watermarking to all DCPs, and re-trained exhibitors to scan for night-vision goggles.</p>
      <p><strong>Result:</strong> Endgame still opened to $1.2 B, but Marvel institutionalized 11th-hour watermark audits for every film since.</p>
      <h3>2. Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) – Trailer Leak 1-Up</h3>
      <p><strong>What dropped:</strong> The first teaser (full 1080p) appeared 6 days early on a random Vimeo account.</p>
      <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Marvel pulled the trigger within 90 minutes and posted the official 4K version the same night, owning the narrative instead of chasing it.</p>
      <p><strong>Result:</strong> “Shadow-drop” became SOP; every major trailer now has a pre-loaded upload ready to go if an early copy surfaces.</p>
      <h3>3. Avengers: Doomsday (2025) – Concept-Art Avalanche</h3>
      <p><strong>What dropped:</strong> Dozens of concept sheets (Battleworld map, Doom’s mask variants, Kang’s corpse in a time-coffin) hit Reddit & Twitter weeks before Cinemacon.</p>
      <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Studio scrapped the planned April 2026 drip-feed and merged Armor Wars montage into the film itself, folding a solo movie into a 45-minute war sequence to control the reveal cadence.</p>
      <p><strong>Result:</strong> Phase 7 slate rewritten; Armor Wars no longer exists as a stand-alone.</p>
      <h3>4. Spider-Man: Brand New Day (2026) – Memory-Spell Dialogue Leak</h3>
      <p><strong>What dropped:</strong> Transcript of Peter meeting a multiversal “Editor” who offers to erase the world’s memory of Peter Parker—again.</p>
      <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Sony deleted a redundant “Mephisto temptation” subplot and leaned into the meta-comedy of “We already forgot you once.”</p>
      <p><strong>Result:</strong> Script trimmed 18 pages, pacing tightened, and the film now opens with a cold-open fourth-wall gag acknowledging the leak.</p>
      <h3>5. Infinity War (2018) – Tom Holland’s “I’m Alive” Poster Slip</h3>
      <p><strong>What dropped:</strong> Holland Instagram-live’d his own poster showing Spider-Man alive on Titan—before Infinity War had even premiered.</p>
      <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Marvel created the “Tom-Holland-can’t-be-trusted” meme as free cover; since then, actors film spoiler interviews with Ruffalo/Benedict “babysitters” and script pages are printed on red paper (can’t be photocopied).</p>
      <p><strong>Result:</strong> Spoiler culture became marketing theater—controlled “leaks” now double as viral bits.</p>
      <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
      <p>Every mega-leak forced Marvel to trade secrecy for speed—uploading faster, rewriting plots, or simply turning the breach into the joke itself.</p>
      <p>The current Doomsday wave is just the next domino—expect another rule rewrite once the Avatar-attached teasers hit screens.</p>
