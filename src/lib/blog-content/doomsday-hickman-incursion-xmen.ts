<h2>Connecting the Multiversal Dots – Doomsday’s Hickman-Style Incursion & the Fox-X-Men Gambit</h2>
      <h3>1. Endgame = Incursion Zero</h3>
      <p>The Time Heist didn’t just steal stones — it fractured causality:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
      <li>– 2014 Thanos jumping forward</li>
      <li>– Loki escaping with the Tesseract</li>
      <li>– Steve staying in 1945</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These unauthorized branches are cosmic bruises that never healed.</p>
      <p>→ MCU-616 is now the “guilty Earth” in Hickman’s incursion logic — the universe that broke the contract with linear time.</p>
      <h3>2. Monica = Canary in the Colliding Mine</h3>
      <p>Post-credits of The Marvels: Monica wakes up on Earth-10005 — the designated Fox-X-Men universe.</p>
      <p>Incursion trigger: Her mere presence is foreign mass in a foreign timeline — physics starts counting down to two-Earths-touch.</p>
      <p>Story function:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
      <li>– Audience POV — we experience Earth-10005’s culture shock through her.</li>
      <li>– Stakes amplifier — mutant homeland is not a cameo playground; it’s the other half of the collision.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>3. Doctor Doom’s Battle-Plan (Leaked Synopsis + Theory)</h3>
      <p>Official line: Doom will “unleash a cascading crisis across the entire Multiverse”.</p>
      <p>Translation:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
      <li>– Step 1 — identify every universe’s “Anchor Being” (a Molecule-Man substitute).</li>
      <li>– Step 2 — kill those anchors, forcing each reality to implode into the Void (MCU’s junk-yard realm).</li>
      <li>– Step 3 — stitch the surviving shards into a single Battleworld under one iron mask.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Monica & the Fox-X-Men Earth are Anchor #1 — their extinction event starts the domino fall.</p>
      <h3>4. Fox-verse ≠ Cameo Candy – It’s the Opposition</h3>
      <p>Narrative role reversal:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
      <li>– MCU heroes = incursion perpetrators (because of Endgame).</li>
      <li>– Fox-X-Men = innocent collateral who must fight back or be erased.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Emotional hook: Wolverine, Storm, Magneto defending their world from Avengers’ timeline-mess — audience sympathy splits, Civil-War-style.</p>
      <h3>5. Visual Blueprint – Hickman on Screen</h3>
      <p>Two Earths in telescope cross-hairs — red line of incursion creeping across space-time radar.</p>
      <p>Desert Void set (leaked filming) = collision ground zero — floating X-Mansion ruins beside Avengers Tower debris.</p>
      <p>Final beat: Doom stands between the cracking planets, absorbing the energy wave — not saving either, harvesting both.</p>
      <h3>🎯 Bottom Line</h3>
      <p>Marvel is lifting Hickman’s incursion beat-for-beat, but pinning the blame on its own heroes:</p>
      <p>Steve Rogers’ retirement in 1945 and Monica’s accidental hop turn Earth-616 vs. Earth-10005 into the prime collision.</p>
      <p>Doom doesn’t cause the crash — he manages it, positioning himself as the only architect who can “stitch” the broken multiverse into Battleworld.</p>
      <p>Fox-X-Men aren’t cameos — they’re the other Earth fighting for survival, making Avengers: Doomsday the direct sequel to Endgame’s temporal hubris — and the first Avengers movie where our side might be the villain.</p>
