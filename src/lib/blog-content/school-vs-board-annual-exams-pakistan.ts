      <h2>School vs Board Annual Exams in Pakistan</h2>
      <p>(Why your school test feels like a kheil and the board paper feels like a jungle ka safari)</p>
      <p><em>"School exams teach you to walk; board exams teach you to run with bricks in your backpack — barefoot."</em></p>
      
      <h3>1. Who Owns the Paper? — "Apna ghar vs federal fort"</h3>
      <div class="overflow-x-auto">
        <table class="min-w-full border-collapse border border-border">
          <thead>

              <td class="border border-border p-2">Your subject teacher (maybe "Sir Aslam" who also takes your tuition)</td>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">Anonymous board panel (usually a professor from another city)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">Checker</td>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">Same school staff (knows your handwriting — and your attendance)</td>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">External examiner (doesn’t know you, doesn’t care)</td>

      </div>
      <p class="mt-2">Bottom line: School might gift you 3 grace marks; board will not even gift you a smiley.</p>

      <h3>2. Weight & Stakes — "Report-card vs life-card"</h3>
      <p>School exam = 5-10 % weight in final board aggregate (only if your board counts internal assessment).</p>
      <p>Board exam = 90-100 % weight for matric/inter certificate — universities, scholarships, jobs, even "rishta" market look at this number.</p>
      <p>Fail school → repeat class, but fail board → SUPPLEMENTARY (summer ruined, parents’ glare level 999).</p>

      <h3>4. Syllabus Coverage — "Half plate vs full thaali"</h3>
      <p>School may skip 1-2 chapters ("time khatam hogaya") — board never skips anything printed in PTB 2026 edition.</p>
      <p>School can give unit tests on recent topics; board expects entire book — index to glossary.</p>
      <p>Competency-based questions (case-study, data interpretation) ≥ 25 % in board 2026; school rarely bothers.</p>

      <h3>6. Marking Mind-set — "Meherbaani vs machine"</h3>
      <p>School teacher may gift steps-marks because "isme effort nazar aaya".</p>
      <p>Board examiner follows step-wise marking scheme; no grace unless rubric allows.</p>
      <p>Board also penalises for:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>– Wrong question number → zero</li>
        <li>– Red / green ink → zero</li>
        <li>– Over-writing without neat box → -1 in MCQ section</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7. Preparation Strategy — Two Different Playbooks</h3>
      <h4>School Exam Prep</h4>
      <p>Teacher hints = gold; class tests = free mock.</p>
      <p>Finish lab-file on time — practical marks are 100 % in teacher’s hand.</p>
      <p>Revise teacher’s notes; many repeat questions.</p>
      <h4>Board Exam Prep</h4>
      <p>Past 5-year papers = compulsory; 30-40 % repetition guaranteed.</p>
      <p>Board marking scheme PDF — memorise key words ("define, explain, draw, label").</p>
      <p>Practice full-length 3-hour papers; build hand stamina (cramps are real).</p>
      <p>Neatness & question-numbering — presentation = easy 5 marks.</p>

      <h3>9. Cost of Ignoring the Difference</h3>
      <p>Only studying school notes → miss 25 % board syllabus → supplementary.</p>
      <p>Only studying board past-papers → fail school practical file → internal 0/25 → final grade drops.</p>
      <p>Smart strategy: Use school exams as dress-rehearsals, board exams as the real drama.</p>
