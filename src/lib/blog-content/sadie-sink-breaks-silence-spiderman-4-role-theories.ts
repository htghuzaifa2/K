      <h2>Sadie Sink Breaks Her Silence on Spider-Man 4 Role & Theories</h2>
      <p>As filming continues on Spider-Man: Brand New Day, the mystery surrounding Sadie Sink's character has become one of the movie's biggest talking points. The actress has finally addressed the swirling fan theories, including the persistent rumor that she will play the iconic X-Men hero Jean Grey.</p>
      
      <h3>The Actress Addresses the Rumors</h3>
      <p>In a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, Sink was asked directly about the online speculation regarding her role. She revealed that the most prominent rumor—that she would be playing Jean Grey—was something she found puzzling, as it began circulating long before she was even involved with the project. “That was happening before I even knew that I would be working on this project,” she clarified. “I was like, ‘Wait! What are people talking about?’”.</p>
      
      <p>When asked about other theories, many of which focus on her character's red hair, Sink offered a clever, non-revealing response that has only fueled more speculation: “A lot of people forget that hair color can change, but yeah, I understand all of the theories”. She remained tight-lipped about any concrete details, telling fans, “People will just have to wait and see. I’m excited for all of it to maybe be put to rest”.</p>
      
      <h3>Production Pause Following Tom Holland's Injury</h3>
      <p>The interview comes after a brief but notable disruption to the film's production. In late September 2025, filming in London was paused for a week after star Tom Holland suffered a mild concussion during a stunt.</p>
      
      <p>According to reports, Holland was taken to the hospital as a precaution but was not admitted. The production halt was described as a standard safety measure, as the film could not shoot scenes without its lead actor. Sources confirmed that the one-week pause, with filming set to resume on September 29, would not impact the movie's scheduled July 31, 2026, release date.</p>
      
      <h3>The Road Ahead</h3>
      <p>Despite the brief setback, excitement for the film remains high. Sink is confirmed to reprise her mystery Marvel role in the upcoming Avengers: Secret Wars, which is scheduled to begin filming in London in 2026. For now, both the actress and Marvel Studios are committed to keeping her Spider-Man: Brand New Day character a secret, ensuring that audiences will have to wait until the film's release to have all their questions answered.</p>
