      <h2>💻 Top 5 2-in-1 Laptops for Pakistani Developers & Designers (2026 Forecast)</h2>
      <p>A review of convertible laptops for web developers, UI/UX designers, and creatives in Pakistan, with buying tips for 2026.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> 2-in-1 convertibles are premium and cost more than standard laptops. They are worth it for sketching, demos, and design work. For raw compute power, consider a workstation.</p>
      
      <h2>How I picked these five</h2>
      <p>I focused on models with color-accurate touch/pen support, good keyboards, decent thermals, good battery life, and modern ports.</p>
      
      <h2>1) Lenovo Yoga 9i (Aura / Gen 10 family) — The creative all-rounder</h2>
      <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> Bright OLED options, good pen support, and AI helpers. Excellent color and a durable 360° hinge. A comfy middle ground for designers who code.</p>
      <p><strong>Good for:</strong> UI/UX designers, freelancers doing client demos, devs who value display fidelity.</p>
      <p><strong>Watch out for:</strong> Premium price, some configs prioritize thinness over thermals.</p>
      
      <h2>2) HP Spectre x360 (14″ / 16″) — Premium, polished convertible</h2>
      <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> Leads in build quality. Glossy OLED options, strong keyboard, and powerful Intel Ultra/Core CPUs for heavier web tasks. HP markets AI features and high brightness screens.</p>
      <p><strong>Good for:</strong> Designers wanting a beautiful canvas, devs needing occasional CPU bursts.</p>
      <p><strong>Watch out for:</strong> Price. Ensure you get specs that will last.</p>
      
      <h2>3) Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 / XPS 13 family — Compact, professional, reliable</h2>
      <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> Balances a compact footprint with high-quality touch displays and reliable keyboards. Good for developers who value a premium typing experience and portability.</p>
      <p><strong>Good for:</strong> Students, traveling devs, and designers prioritizing portability.</p>
      <p><strong>Watch out for:</strong> Smaller 13" screen area might not be ideal for all design work.</p>
      
      <h2>4) Microsoft Surface Pro 9 / Surface Pro (detachable) — Tablet-first flexibility</h2>
      <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> The classic detachable. Tablet-first with an excellent pen experience and pixel-dense displays. Superb for illustrators, UX people, and presenters.</p>
      <p><strong>Good for:</strong> Designers who sketch wireframes, devs needing extreme portability.</p>
      <p><strong>Watch out for:</strong> Smaller battery and fewer ports. Pair with a dock for serious dev work.</p>
      
      <h2>5) Asus (ZenBook / VivoBook) Flip series — Value + OLED options</h2>
      <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> Large OLED touch screens, solid battery life, and competitive pricing. The 16-inch Vivobook Flip offers a larger canvas for designers.</p>
      <p><strong>Good for:</strong> Designers wanting larger touch canvases, devs wanting a balance of price and features.</p>
      <p><strong>Watch out for:</strong> Keyboard feel varies by model, so test it if you type a lot.</p>
      
      <h3>Honorable mention: Samsung Galaxy Book 5 / 360</h3>
      <p>Samsung’s 360/Flip models with AMOLED screens and AI features are pushing strong spec lists and can be great options where Samsung service is available.</p>
