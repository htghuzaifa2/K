      <h2>From Iron Man to Iron Tyrant: The Strategic Casting of Robert Downey Jr. as Doctor Doom</h2>
      <h3>🧠 Meta-Narrative: The Return That Rewrites the Rules</h3>
      <p>Marvel isn’t just bringing back a beloved actor—it’s weaponizing a decade of audience affection. RDJ’s Tony Stark died in Endgame, a moment fans still treat as sacred. Re-casting him as Doctor Doom instantly weaponizes that emotional equity: every cheer, every tear, every “I love you 3000” now echoes uncomfortably behind a steel mask and monologue about multiversal order. The shock value alone guarantees Doomsday headlines before a single trailer drops.</p>
      <h3>🪞 Doom as the Dark Mirror of Tony Stark</h3>
      <p>Genius-billionaire-playboy — both refuse to lose. Tony learned sacrifice (the Snap). Doom learns control (Battleworld). RDJ playing both sides lets the MCU stage the debate on-screen: “What if the man who saved the universe decided saving wasn’t enough—and ruling was the only guarantee it stayed saved?”</p>
      <h3>🧬 Comic Precedent: Stark Becoming Doom</h3>
      <p>Marvel Team-Up (2004) shows an alternate Stark who becomes Doom after failing to stop Thanos. The MCU can now swear this isn’t a Tony variant while mining Stark iconography—same face, different soul.</p>
      <h3>🛡️ Armor Evolution: Grace vs. Tyranny</h3>
      <p>Stark tech: curves, glowing arcs, nanite fluidity. Doom’s iron mask: brutal, riveted, medieval — same engineer, opposite aesthetic.</p>
      <h3>⚖️ Risk vs. Reward</h3>

      <h3 class="mt-4">🎯 Endgame (Meta)</h3>
      <p>By fusing actor and antagonist, Marvel short-circuits the “new villain build-up” phase. RDJ’s Doom isn’t just Victor Von — he’s the ghost of Tony’s ego unleashed, a living What If that asks: “What happens when the man who learned to die for others decides everyone else should die for him?” Answer: Iron Man becomes Iron Tyrant — and the MCU’s next saga begins with the face that started it all, turned to steel.</p>
