      <h2>The Four-Trailer Strategy: How Marvel is Using Avatar to Rebuild Avengers Hype</h2>
      <p>Marvel isn’t just dropping a trailer — it’s weaponizing scarcity. Disney’s leaked plan: attach four separate Avengers: Doomsday teasers to Avatar: Fire and Ash — one per week for four weeks — forcing fans to buy four tickets if they want the full picture.</p>
      <h3>🧩 The Rollout Map (Dec 19 → Jan 16)</h3>

      <p class="mt-2">Each teaser is 1 min 25 s, rated overseas, and replaces the previous one every Friday — no online drop until the theatrical window ends.</p>
      <h3>🎯 Why Four? The Psychology of Repeat Viewings</h3>
      <h4>Scarcity = Urgency</h4>
      <p>“See it in 7 days or wait months for HD” triggers FOMO stronger than any Twitter countdown.</p>
      <h4>Ticket Bundles</h4>
      <p>Chains already testing “Avengers Pass” — 4 admissions for price of 3 to soften the cash-grab backlash.</p>
      <h4>Leak Insurance</h4>
      <p>Staggered release means if one cam-rip surfaces, the next three are still virgin—studio keeps narrative control for 28 days straight.</p>
      <h3>💰 Avatar Lifeline</h3>
      <p>Fire and Ash cost ~$300 M and opened to mixed reviews (RT ≈ 69 %). Disney needs repeat butts in seats to justify Avatar 4 & 5 budgets; Marvel trailers become the carrot. Cameron himself endorsed the tactic—“anything that brings people back to the big screen is a win” (podcast quote).</p>
      <h3>⚖️ Fan Backlash vs. Box-Office Math</h3>
      <div class="overflow-x-auto">
        <table class="min-w-full border-collapse border border-border">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th class="border border-border p-2 text-left">Backlash</th>
              <th class="border border-border p-2 text-left">Counter</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">“Gaslighting fans”</td>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">4K super-cut will eventually drop online—scarcity is temporary.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">“I’ll just pirate it”</td>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">Ultrasonic watermark + 18 kHz chirp in each teaser—leaked copies are traceable.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">“No one cares that much”</td>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">Fandango pre-sales for Avatar spiked 38 % in markets that advertised the trailer swap.</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
      <h3 class="mt-4">🧠 Bottom Line</h3>
      <p>Marvel turned a trailer drop into a four-week subscription service—pay-per-hype. Avatar gets the foot traffic, Doomsday gets the headlines, and Disney gets the data on how far fans will drive (and pay) for 85 seconds of new footage. Result: Hype isn’t just rebuilt—it’s monetized by the week.</p>
