      <h2>💻 Used Laptop Market Guide: How to Inspect Laptop Condition Before Buying in Pakistan</h2>
      <p>By the kimi.pk Team</p>
      <p>Buying a used laptop in Pakistan can save you big bucks, especially if you’re a student, freelancer, or web developer on a budget. But without proper inspection, you might end up with hidden issues: weak battery, loud fans, or dead pixels that ruin your experience. Here’s a practical guide to help you shop smart and avoid surprises.</p>
      
      <h3>✅ 1. Check the Battery Health & Cycles</h3>
      <p>Battery wear is one of the first things to check. Most laptops last 2–4 years depending on usage.</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li><strong>Windows:</strong> Run <code>powercfg /batteryreport</code> in Command Prompt to see battery health and cycle count.</li>
        <li><strong>Mac:</strong> Click the Apple logo → About This Mac → System Report → Power. Look for cycle count and condition.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Healthy battery: ~80%+ of original capacity with moderate cycles. Anything below 70% may need replacement soon.</p>
      <p>Ask the seller about charging habits; lithium-ion batteries degrade faster if kept plugged in 24/7.</p>
      
      <h3>✅ 2. Inspect Fan Noise & Thermal Performance</h3>
      <p>Turn on the laptop and listen for unusual fan noise.</p>
      <p>Run a stress test (e.g., open multiple apps, play a video) to see if fans kick in or if it gets unusually hot.</p>
      <p>Overheating can indicate dust, thermal paste issues, or poor maintenance.</p>
      <p>Tip: Fans should ramp up smoothly, not make grinding or rattling sounds.</p>
      
      <h3>✅ 3. Look for Dead or Stuck Pixels</h3>
      <p>Open a blank white, black, red, green, and blue image on full screen.</p>
      <p>Check if any pixels are permanently black, white, or stuck on a single color.</p>
      <p>Dead pixels are usually minimal on older laptops but can be annoying for design, video editing, or coding.</p>
      
      <h3>✅ 4. Test Screen Brightness & Backlight</h3>
      <p>Adjust brightness across all levels to check uniformity.</p>
      <p>Look for flickering or dim corners; uneven backlight may indicate panel wear.</p>
      
      <h3>✅ 5. Examine Keyboard & Trackpad</h3>
      <p>Press every key to ensure it’s responsive and doesn’t stick.</p>
      <p>Check trackpad for smooth gestures and no lag.</p>
      <p>Bonus tip: Some keyboards show wear on frequently used keys — this can hint at heavy past usage.</p>
      
      <h3>✅ 6. Check Ports & Connectivity</h3>
      <p>USB, HDMI, SD card slot, headphone jack — plug in devices to test functionality.</p>
      <p>Wi-Fi and Bluetooth should connect reliably.</p>
      <p>If you’re a web developer, make sure your ports are sufficient for work setup: external keyboard, mouse, monitor, or hub.</p>
      
      <h3>✅ 7. Verify Warranty / Original Parts</h3>
      <p>Ask for the original invoice if possible.</p>
      <p>Check if the laptop is registered with the manufacturer for warranty.</p>
      <p>Replacements of screens, battery, or keyboard may affect resale value and authenticity.</p>
      
      <h3>✅ 8. Optional: Run Benchmark / Performance Test</h3>
      <p>Check CPU, GPU, RAM performance with tools like Cinebench, Geekbench, or Windows built-in Performance Monitor.</p>
      <p>Compare with specs of a new similar laptop to ensure it still performs adequately.</p>
      
      <h3>💡 Bonus Tip for Pakistani Buyers</h3>
      <p>While inspecting, consider pairing your laptop with a reliable wireless keyboard for comfortable typing during long hours of coding, studying, or remote work. For example, the <a href="https://kimi.pk/products/omoton-kb036-wireless-bluetooth-keyboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OMOTON KB036 Bluetooth Keyboard</a> is a popular choice locally — smooth, silent, long battery life, and compatible with Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS devices. It’s ideal for students and developers who want a clean desk setup without investing in an entirely new laptop.</p>
      
      <h3>📌 Final Thoughts</h3>
      <p>Buying a used laptop in Pakistan can be a smart choice, but it requires careful inspection. Focus on battery health, fan performance, screen condition, and keyboard functionality. Pair it with reliable accessories like a quality wireless keyboard and you’ll have a setup that’s budget‑friendly yet highly functional.</p>
      <p>“Inspect well, buy smart, and your second-hand laptop will feel like a first-class companion.”</p>
