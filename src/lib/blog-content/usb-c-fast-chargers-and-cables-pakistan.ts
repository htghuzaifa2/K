      <h2>⚡ Top USB‑C Fast Chargers & Cables in Pakistan: What’s Safe, What’s Not</h2>
      <p>By the kimi.pk Team</p>
      <p>In 2025‑26 Pakistan, fast charging is no longer a luxury — it’s a necessity. With remote work, online classes, coding sessions, mobile dev setups, and travel between cities, you need power that keeps up. But when you buy a USB‑C charger or cable, you’re not just buying convenience — you’re buying safety.</p>
      <p>We’re surrounded by low‑quality or fake chargers, overheated cables, and devices that don’t deliver on their “65 W” or “100 W” labels. So here’s how to navigate the market in Pakistan: what to look for, safe brands, fakes to avoid, and recommendations.</p>
      
      <h2>✅ What to look for: Chargers & Cables Specs</h2>
      <h3>Chargers:</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li><strong>GaN (Gallium Nitride) tech:</strong> Smaller, cooler, higher efficiency — the modern standard for serious fast chargers.</li>
        <li><strong>Wattage & PD (Power Delivery) / PPS support:</strong> E.g., 65 W, 100 W; PD 3.0 or PPS for newer devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple ports:</strong> If you charge laptop + phone, look for 2‑port or 3‑port chargers.</li>
        <li><strong>Build and certification:</strong> Pick brands with certifications, proper plug safety, and good ventilation.</li>
        <li><strong>Local warranty & service:</strong> In Pakistan, buying from trusted distributors matters — fake or cheap units may fail or overheat.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Cables:</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li><strong>USB‑C to USB‑C (or USB‑C to USB‑A):</strong> For modern devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Cable thick‑ness / gauge / quality:</strong> A 100 W charging cable must support higher current; cheap thin cables may overheat.</li>
        <li><strong>Certification (E‑Mark, USB‑IF) if you want serious specs.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Shielding & strain relief:</strong> Good cables last years; cheap ones fray.</li>
        <li><strong>Length matters:</strong> Longer cables may drop voltage slightly — for fast charging keep cable ~1 m or less where possible.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🇵🇰 Pakistan Market Reality: What to Watch For</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
          <li>Many local importers and Daraz/e‑commerce listings claim “100W charger” but don’t show brand specs or GaN design.</li>
          <li>Fake or low‑quality cables can cause device damage — overheated phones, slower charging, or no compatibility with laptops.</li>
          <li>Check seller ratings and warranty—brands with local presence (and good service) are safer.</li>
          <li>Price ranges: good GaN chargers (65W) in Pakistan: ~₨ 8,000–15,000; cables rated for 100W: ~₨ 2,000–5,000 depending on brand and quality. Always compare specs not just price.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🛑 What’s Unsafe / What to Avoid</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>“65W” printed on charger but no brand or certification — may not deliver full wattage, may overheat.</li>
        <li>Cables that are extremely thin with “100W support” claims but no certification.</li>
        <li>Chargers with minimal ventilation in hot rooms (Pakistani summers!) that get hot quickly.</li>
        <li>Buying from very low‑rated sellers with no returns or warranty — risk of product failure or damage.</li>
        <li>Using a cheap cable with a high‑watt charger for laptop — the cable may bottleneck the charging or risk heat damage.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🏆 Safe & Recommended Picks (General Advice)</h2>
      <p>While I won’t list specific model links (you’ll find current listings on Pakistani stores easily), look for features like:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>65 W GaN charger from a brand with local warranty and multiple ports.</li>
        <li>100 W GaN charger if you have a USB‑C laptop (and a quality cable).</li>
        <li>Cable rated for 100 W, USB‑C to USB‑C, ~1 m length, from trusted brand, strain relief ends.</li>
        <li>Use your charger for multiple devices (phone, tablet, hotspot) but avoid leaving it on high load in a closed cupboard in summer — ventilation matters.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>📌 Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>In Pakistan’s tech‑driven lives, fast charging is as much about uptime as it is convenience. But safety, reliability and long‑term use matter just as much as watt‑count. Choose your charger and cable like you choose your laptop: with specs, warranty and trust.</p>
