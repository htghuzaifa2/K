      <h2>📡 Understanding 5G & Beyond: What It Means for Web Developers in Pakistan</h2>
      <p>With faster mobile networks coming to Pakistan, web developers must gear up for bigger changes: faster speeds, new features, design and performance shifts. Here’s what to watch and how to prepare for the 2026-27 era.</p>
      
      <h2>🇵🇰 Why 5G matters in Pakistan</h2>
      <p>Pakistan’s rollout plan aims to deploy 5G services in major cities by 2025 and beyond. The promise: much faster download speeds, lower latency, and a denser device network. For you as a web developer, this shift is your playground evolving.</p>
      
      <h2>🔍 What changes for web development when 5G becomes common</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
          <li><strong>Performance expectations go up:</strong> Users will expect near-instant responses, complex interactions without lag, and real-time features.</li>
          <li><strong>More advanced features become practical:</strong> Richer multimedia like 4K/8K video, AR previews, and real-time data dashboards.</li>
          <li><strong>Mobile-first becomes mobile-rich:</strong> You can build richer experiences for mobile, but must still optimize for a wide range of devices and network conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>Edge computing & distributed architecture may matter:</strong> Processing closer to the user, with better offline/online sync.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🛠️ How you should prepare as a web developer in Pakistan (2026-27 mindset)</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
          <li><strong>Continue to master performance skills:</strong> Lazy-load, use modern image formats (WebP, AVIF), minify code, and use service workers.</li>
          <li><strong>Design richer mobile experiences:</strong> Think beyond just a "simpler version" for small screens.</li>
          <li><strong>Build network-adaptive logic:</strong> Detect network conditions to adjust media quality.</li>
          <li><strong>Architect for realtime and edge scenarios:</strong> Use WebSockets, SSE, and CDNs with edge functions.</li>
          <li><strong>Test broadly in Pakistani contexts:</strong> Use lower-end Android phones and simulate variable network conditions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>📍 Local examples and implications for Pakistani market</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li><strong>E-commerce:</strong> Add richer product media like 360° views and video previews.</li>
        <li><strong>Education:</strong> Enable live interactive classes and AR/VR modules.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart city/IoT dashboards:</strong> Build web dashboards that receive real-time sensor data.</li>
        <li><strong>Media & streaming:</strong> Support higher quality adaptive video streaming.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>✨ Final Words</h2>
      <p>The mobile revolution in Pakistan is accelerating. With 5G and beyond, your role as a web developer gets richer and more challenging. Embrace performance, adaptivity, and a mobile-first-plus philosophy, and you’ll stay ahead of the curve.</p>
