      <h2>🔄 How to Transfer Your Board Affiliation in Pakistan</h2>
      <p>By the kimi.pk Team</p>
      <p>Moving to a new city or province in Pakistan? If you’re a Matric or Intermediate student, transferring your board affiliation is essential so you can appear for exams under the correct regional board. Here’s a clear, step-by-step guide for 2026.</p>
      
      <h3>🔹 Step 1: Understand Why Transfer Is Needed</h3>
      <p>Board affiliation determines exam roll numbers, admit cards, and results.</p>
      <p>If you’ve moved from Punjab to Sindh, or from Karachi to Lahore, you must register with the new provincial board.</p>
      <p>Without this, you risk being barred from exams or having delayed results.</p>
      
      <h3>🔹 Step 2: Contact Your Current School / Board</h3>
      <p>Inform your current school administration about your move.</p>
      <p>They will provide guidance on transfer forms and the no-objection certificate (NOC) required by the new board.</p>
      <p>Boards like FBISE, BISE Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, and Quetta all have similar transfer procedures but may differ slightly in fees.</p>
      
      <h3>🔹 Step 3: Prepare Required Documents</h3>
      <p>Commonly required documents for board transfer in Pakistan include:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>Copy of previous mark sheets or report cards</li>
        <li>NOC from your current school/board</li>
        <li>Proof of new residence (utility bill, rental agreement, or CNIC)</li>
        <li>Recent passport-size photographs</li>
        <li>Application form for transfer (available at the board office or online)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tip: Collect digital copies of all documents; typing the application digitally is faster and reduces errors. A wireless keyboard like the <a href="/products/omoton-kb036-wireless-bluetooth-keyboard">OMOTON KB036 Bluetooth Keyboard</a> is perfect for filling forms efficiently, especially when switching between devices and PDF forms.</p>
      
      <h3>🔹 Step 4: Submit Transfer Application</h3>
      <p>Submit the completed form and documents to the new board office.</p>
      <p>Pay any transfer fee, which usually ranges from PKR 500–2,000, depending on your board and distance.</p>
      <p>Boards generally process transfers 1–3 weeks, so plan ahead to ensure you receive your new roll number on time.</p>
      
      <h3>🔹 Step 5: Follow Up & Confirm</h3>
      <p>After submission, follow up with both old and new boards to ensure approval.</p>
      <p>Once approved, the new roll number and admit card will be issued under the new board.</p>
      
      <h3>✅ Quick Checklist for Board Transfer</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
