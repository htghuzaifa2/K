<h2>Secret Hospital Scene: Which Hero Is Recovering in Doomsday's Leaked Set Photo?</h2>
      <p>A grainy, low-angle shot of a clinical bay — heart-monitor beeps, soft-blue lighting, and a single figure in a bed — has surfaced. No face is visible, but three clues inside the frame let us triage the possibilities.</p>
      <h3>1️⃣ Aged Steve Rogers – The Timeline Tax</h3>
      <p>Visual cue: IV line in the left arm, liver-spotted hand gripping the rail — consistent with 1940s-born skin.</p>
      <p>Story debt: Leaks show Steve living in a 1945 branch; Incursion radiation could rapid-age anyone not native to that timeline.</p>
      <p>Symbolism: Shield is gone — the unbreakable symbol is broken, so the man must break too.</p>
      <p>Probability: High — hospital = consequence of staying in the wrong century.</p>
      <h3>2️⃣ Depowered Scarlet Witch – Magic Burnout</h3>
      <p>Visual cue: Red-tinted EEG leads (a WandaVision Easter-egg callback) and floating tarot cards on the bedside table — chaos magic leaking into medical equipment.</p>
      <p>Power logic: Doom’s sorcery is rumored to siphon mutant magic to fuel Battleworld; Wanda is the battery.</p>
      <p>Meta role: Post-Agatha All Along, Wanda needs a low-point before Secret Wars redemption — coma = crucible.</p>
      <p>Probability: Medium — fits the magic-arc, but hand age doesn’t match Olsen.</p>
      <h3>3️⃣ Bruce Banner – Hulkless & Human</h3>
      <p>Visual cue: Heart-rate spikes to 200 bpm then flat-lines — gamma cells dying, Hulk persona refusing to emerge.</p>
      <p>Dialogue leak: “I can’t feel him anymore” (whispered by Mark Ruffalo in audition sides) — Banner facing mortality without emerald armor.</p>
      <p>Comic parallel: Immortal Hulk #50 — Banner in ICU while Hulk fights in Hell; MCU flips it: Banner in Hell (hospital) while Hulk is AWOL.</p>
      <p>Probability: Medium-High — gives Ruffalo emotional showcase, sets up Hulk’s final rampage.</p>
      <h3>🎯 Bottom Line</h3>
      <p>The liver-spotted hand + left-arm IV + absence of shield = Steve Rogers paying the physical price for timeline tampering.<br>Expect Sam Wilson to push the gurney — passing the torch literally while Steve whispers: “The world still needs your shield.”</p>
