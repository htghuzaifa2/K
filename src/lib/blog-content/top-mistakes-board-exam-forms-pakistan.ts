      <h2>📝 Top Mistakes Students Make During Board Exam Admission Forms in Pakistan</h2>
      <p>By the kimi.pk Team</p>
      <p>Filling out your Matric or Inter board exam admission form in Pakistan may seem straightforward—but one small mistake can delay your registration or even get your form rejected. From Karachi to Peshawar, students often stumble on the same details. Let’s walk through the common mistakes and how to avoid them.</p>
      
      <h3>🔹 1. Wrong or Inconsistent Name Spellings</h3>
      <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Your name on the admission form doesn’t match your school record or previous mark sheet.</p>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use exact spelling from your school certificate and double-check before submission.</p>
      
      <h3>🔹 2. Incorrect Roll Number or Class Details</h3>
      <p>Always confirm your current class (9, 10, 11, 12) and roll number if required. Mistyping can confuse boards, especially when multiple students share similar names.</p>
      
      <h3>🔹 3. Missing or Wrong Personal Details</h3>
      <p>Date of birth, CNIC/B-form number, and father’s name must be accurate.</p>
      <p>Even a small typo can create verification problems later.</p>
      
      <h3>🔹 4. Incomplete Subject Selection</h3>
      <p>Double-check optional subjects and electives; Pakistani boards are strict about subject groupings.</p>
      <p>Missing a subject can mean not being allowed to sit for that exam.</p>
      
      <h3>🔹 5. Poor or Blurred Attachments</h3>
      <p>Many boards require scanned or photocopied documents.</p>
      <p>Use clear photocopies, preferably scanned PDFs.</p>
      
      <h3>🔹 6. Wrong Fee Submission</h3>
      <p>Each board has a specified fee. Sending the wrong amount can delay your registration.</p>
      <p>Always keep a receipt copy.</p>
      
      <h3>🔹 7. Last-Minute Submission & Technical Errors</h3>
      <p>Online forms may crash on the last day due to heavy traffic.</p>
      <p>Submit early to avoid network issues or mobile glitches.</p>
      
      <h3>💡 Pro Tip for Students in Pakistan</h3>
      <p>Managing forms, downloading PDFs, or keeping track of multiple board requirements can be tedious. A reliable keyboard can make the process smoother.
