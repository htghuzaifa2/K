<h2>Decoding the Russo Bros’ “V” Tease – Vision, Yggdrasil, or Simply a Countdown?</h2>
      <p>A grainy, black-and-white “V” is all it took for the internet to explode. Here’s what the symbol could mean — and why each theory carries weight:</p>
      <h3>1️⃣ V = Vision (Paul Bettany)</h3>
      <p>Timing check: Bettany told The Telegraph he has “Avengers duties next year” — almost certainly Secret Wars reshoots.</p>
      <p>Visual precedent: Vision’s forehead gem and angular face plate form a perfect “V” silhouette when lit from below — the teaser’s high-contrast lighting could be a macro shot of the Mind-Stone facet.</p>
      <p>Narrative fit: VisionQuest (2026) ends with White Vision reassembling his identity; Doomsday/Secret Wars would be the pay-off stage for that arc.</p>
      <p>Probability: High — the actor’s own words + iconic silhouette = safest bet.</p>
      <h3>2️⃣ V = Yggdrasil / Branched Timeline</h3>
      <p>Loki callback: World-Tree branches were drawn as two diverging lines in Loki S1; the Russo image shows a darkened left branch — a corrupted timeline.</p>
      <p>Story hook: Leaks say Steve Rogers’ past stay created a nexus fracture; Doom will weaponize that split to collapse realities into Battleworld.</p>
      <p>Meta symmetry: Directors love fractal imagery (see Infinity War soul-stone orange-filter) — a single “V” is the smallest unit of a multiversal mosaic.</p>
      <p>Probability: Medium — symbolically perfect, but less actor-driven hype.</p>
      <h3>3️⃣ V = Victor Von Doom</h3>
      <p>Name drop: V is literally the first letter of Victor and the third of Von — RDJ’s new character.</p>
      <p>Logo play: Marvel could be splitting the classic “A” of Avengers into two jagged “V”s — hero vs. villain typography.</p>
      <p>Marketing beat: Simple, on-brand, and keeps the mask on until the trailer drop.</p>
      <p>Probability: Medium-Low — too on-the-nose for Russo-level cryptic games.</p>
      <h3>4️⃣ V = Roman-Numeral 5 / Countdown</h3>
      <p>Calendar math: Post dropped 5 days before Avatar: Fire and Ash — the first of four exclusive trailer windows.</p>
      <p>Avenger count: Doomsday is the 5th Avengers film — V = 5 is elegant meta-nod.</p>
      <p>Countdown culture: Russos love incremental reveals (Infinity War 10-year anniversary countdown).</p>
      <p>Probability: Low — fun Easter-egg, not lore-relevant.</p>
      <h3>🎯 Bottom Line</h3>
      <p>The “V” is a Rorschach test:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
      <li>Vision fans see Mind-Stone geometry.</li>
      <li>Loki stans see Yggdrasil branches.</li>
      <li>Logo watchers see Doom’s initial.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With four trailers hitting Avatar screens starting this week, we’ll know which layer the Russos wanted us to peel within days — but for now, the ambiguity is the marketing.</p>
