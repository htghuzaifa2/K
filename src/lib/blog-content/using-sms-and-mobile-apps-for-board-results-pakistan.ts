      <h2>📲 Using SMS & Mobile Apps to Check Board Results in Pakistan</h2>
      <p>By the kimi.pk Team</p>
      <p>Board exam results are the most awaited moment for students across Pakistan — from Karachi to Peshawar. While websites are the standard method, SMS and mobile apps have made checking results faster and more convenient. Here’s everything you need to know for 2026.</p>
      
      <h3>🔹 1. Official SMS Codes</h3>
      <p>Many boards allow students to receive results via SMS. The typical procedure:</p>
      <p>Format: ROLLNUMBER → send to board-specific code</p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li><strong>Punjab Board:</strong> 800295</li>
        <li><strong>Karachi Board:</strong> 8899</li>
        <li><strong>FBISE (Federal):</strong> 5050</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Quick, works on any mobile, doesn’t need internet.<br><strong>Cons:</strong> Small fee per SMS, prone to typos (double-check roll number).</p>
      
      <h3>🔹 2. Official Mobile Apps</h3>
      <p>Several boards have official apps for result notifications and mark sheet downloads:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>FBISE Result App</li>
        <li>Punjab Board Official App</li>
        <li>Sindh BISE Karachi App</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Free, digital mark sheet access, notifications<br><strong>Cons:</strong> Some apps are slow during peak traffic; check app source to avoid fake apps.</p>
      
      <h3>🔹 3. Third-Party Portals</h3>
      <p>There are multiple portals claiming to provide board results instantly. Use with caution:</p>
      <p>Examples: ilmkidunya.com, examresult.pk, prokpk.com</p>
      <p>Always verify the official roll number and marks with the board’s official portal.</p>
      <p><strong>Caution:</strong> Avoid portals asking for payment or personal data outside official apps or SMS.</p>
      
      <h3>💡 Pro Tip for Pakistani Students</h3>
      <p>Checking results often means typing roll numbers, downloading PDFs, or taking screenshots. For faster and error-free typing, a reliable keyboard can make the process easier.
