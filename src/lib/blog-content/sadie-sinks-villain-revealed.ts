      <h2>Sadie Sink’s Villain Revealed: Why Shathra is the Perfect Spider-Man Foe</h2>
      <p>A single line of leaked dialogue — “You’re a mess, Spider-Man. Don’t get in my way. Otherwise, it won’t just be your friends who don’t remember who Peter Parker is.” — has peeled back the mask on Sadie Sink’s MCU role: she’s Shathra, the Spider-Wasp, a cosmic nightmare tailor-made to torment Peter Parker on every level.</p>
      <h3>🧬 Who Is Shathra? (Comic Core)</h3>
      <p>First appearance: Amazing Spider-Man (2005) – JMS run. Origin: A predatory entity from the Astral Plane, claiming to be the natural enemy of all Spider-Totems.</p>
      <p>Power set:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>Shape-shifting (human, wasp, hybrid forms)</li>
        <li>Venomous stingers that bypass spider-sense</li>
        <li>Dream-weaving – she injects false memories and feeds on emotional trauma</li>

      <h3>🧠 Why Shathra Is a Psychological Villain, Not a Physical One</h3>
      <h4>Feeds on Identity Crisis</h4>
      <p>Post-No Way Home, Peter already lives in a self-imposed witness-protection program. Shathra amplifies that isolation – “You’re a mess” hits because he believes it.</p>
      <h4>Shape-shifting = Trust Decay</h4>
      <p>Leaked trailer shows multiple characters hallucinating; MJ sees Peter as a monster, May sees Ben alive. Shathra becomes the person Peter loves most in any given scene, forcing him to throw punches at his own heart.</p>
      <h4>Dream-weaving as “Final Boss of Therapy”</h4>
      <p>Comics: she lures Peter into a fake domestic life with Gwen-children, then reveals the nest of wasp larvae. MCU rumor: final battle is inside a shared dreamscape where every punch Peter lands erases one civilian’s memory of Spider-Man. Victory condition: Peter must accept being forgotten to save the city—the inverse of No Way Home’s sacrifice.</p>
      <h3>🕸️ Why She’s Perfect for Brand New Day</h3>
      <p>Street-level + Cosmic scale: No sky-beam portal, but reality’s fabric is unraveling inside Peter’s head. Merch-friendly forms: Human Sadie, wasp-hybrid, glowing astral queen—three Funko pops out of one casting. Young Avengers hook: Shathra’s hive corrupts other Spider-heroes (Miles, Gwen?) setting up multiverse team-up in Secret Wars.</p>
      <h3>🎯 Endgame of the Arc</h3>
      <p>Shathra doesn’t want to rule; she wants to prove the Spider-myth is a mistake. Peter’s win condition: embrace the mess—admit he is a mess—robbing her of emotional fuel. Post-credit sting: a single wasp wing left on May’s gravestone—Shathra’s alive in the subconscious, waiting for Secret Wars.</p>
      <p>Bottom line: Shathra turns Spider-Man’s greatest power—being the every-day hero people trust—into a psychological weapon aimed straight at his psyche. She’s not the villain Peter punches; she’s the villain Peter has to out-grow—and that’s brand-new territory for the MCU.</p>
