      <h2>🎓 What Happens After Intermediate Results: Careers, Colleges & Admission Pathways in Pakistan</h2>
      <p>By the kimi.pk Team</p>
      <p>The day your Intermediate (HSSC) results arrive is exciting — a mix of relief, celebration, and big decisions. Many students across Pakistan wonder: What’s next? Which college or university should I choose? Do I need bridging courses? Let’s break it down step by step.</p>
      
      <h3>🔹 1. Understand Your Results</h3>
      <p>Check your marks, subject-wise grades, and overall percentage carefully.</p>
      <p>Compare with admission requirements of universities or colleges you’re interested in.</p>
      <p>Keep digital copies of your result — PDF or screenshot — for applications.</p>
      <p>Tip: Typing forms, updating personal info, and storing documents is easier with a reliable keyboard. We recommend the <a href="/products/omoton-kb036-wireless-bluetooth-keyboard">OMOTON KB036 Bluetooth Keyboard</a> — silent scissor-switch keys, wide device compatibility, and long battery life for managing your post-results tasks efficiently.</p>
      
      <h3>🔹 2. Choose the Right College or University</h3>
      <p><strong>Science / Engineering Students:</strong> Look for universities like NED, UET, LUMS, or your local top college. Check entry test requirements.</p>
      <p><strong>Commerce / Business Students:</strong> Consider IBA, Karachi University, Punjab University or professional courses in accounting, finance, or marketing.</p>
      <p><strong>Arts / Humanities:</strong> Explore local colleges, arts academies, or online diploma courses for creative fields.</p>
      <p>Consider factors like fees, location, faculty, and reputation.</p>
      
      <h3>🔹 3. Vocational & Skill-Based Options</h3>
      <p>Not everyone wants to go the traditional university route. Pakistan has growing demand for tech, coding, design, and digital marketing skills.</p>
      <p>Platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and local bootcamps help students start earning while learning.</p>
      
      <h3>🔹 4. Bridging Courses</h3>
      <p>If your desired university course has prerequisites you didn’t study in HSSC, look for bridging programs:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>Foundation in Mathematics</li>
        <li>English & Communication Skills</li>
        <li>Science / IT prep courses</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These help you catch up quickly and perform better in your first year.</p>
      
      <h3>🔹 5. Managing Applications & Deadlines</h3>
      <p>Keep a calendar of university deadlines.</p>
      <p>Gather required documents: mark sheets, CNIC/B-form, domicile, passport photos.</p>
      <p>Use digital tools to fill forms, track submissions, and organize PDFs efficiently. A wireless keyboard like the <a href="/products/omoton-kb036-wireless-bluetooth-keyboard">OMOTON KB036</a> makes this process smoother and faster.</p>
      
      <h3>✅ Quick Checklist</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>Verify your marks and grades.</li>
        <li>Research universities, colleges, and courses that suit your career goals.</li>
