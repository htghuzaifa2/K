<h2>The "Incursion Baby" Theory – How One Crib Could Crack the Multiverse</h2>
      <h3>Core Claim</h3>
      <p>The infant Steve Rogers cradles in the Doomsday teaser is Sharon Rogers — his biological daughter with Peggy Carter — born inside an alternate timeline that Steve himself created when he chose to stay in 1945 instead of returning to 2023.<br>
      That single act of personal happiness is being framed by fans (and now by several scoopers) as Ground Zero of a cosmic collision — the first domino in a chain-reaction called an Incursion.</p>
      <h3>1. Timeline Mechanics – How Steve Created a New Earth</h3>
      <p>Endgame logic: when Steve remained in the past, he didn’t “live secretly inside the main MCU” — he branched off a new reality-line (call it Earth-Stay).</p>
      <p>Branch birth = mass-energy debt: the sudden appearance of an entire duplicate cosmos (people, planets, stars) owes a cosmic energy bill — Incursion physics demands one Earth must be erased to balance the ledger.</p>
      <p>Baby = anchor point: Sharon’s birth is the first native event of that new Earth — a living receipt that the timeline is real and must be paid for.</p>
      <h3>2. Who Is Sharon Rogers? (Comic Blueprint)</h3>
      <p>Earth-415 (Marvel Future Fight) – Steve never froze, married Peggy, fathered Sharon who grew up to become Captain America.</p>
      <p>Power set: super-soldier lineage + Star-Light Armor (hard-light shield & holo-sword) designed by that reality’s Tony Stark — perfect merchandising hook for MCU Phase 7.</p>
      <p>Symbolism: third shield-bearer (Sam, Steve, Sharon) — paternal mantle passed biologically for the first time.</p>
      <h3>3. Doom’s Motivation – “You Owe Me a Universe”</h3>
      <p>Leak synopsis: Doom’s home reality (call it Earth-Latveria) crumbles when Earth-Stay appears — his sun dims, his people vanish.</p>
      <p>Doom’s logic: Steve’s selfish love stole existence from Doom’s world — therefore Doom is entitled to remake the multiverse into Battleworld where only his people survive.</p>
      <p>Personal stake: Doom isn’t after revenge — he’s collecting reparations; Sharon is the debt token he intends to claim or cage.</p>
      <h3>4. Story Function in Doomsday</h3>
      <p>MacGuffin: Doom needs the anchor baby to stabilize Battleworld’s timeline splice — without Sharon, the patch unravels.</p>
      <p>Moral crucible: Steve must choose – protect his child OR surrender her to save trillions of strangers – fatherhood becomes the ethical engine of the film.</p>
      <p>Pay-off: Thor’s forest prayer mirrors Steve’s plea – both gods beg for one more inch of thread – parental love vs. cosmic duty becomes the emotional spine of the entire saga.</p>
      <h3>🎯 Bottom Line</h3>
      <p>The “Incursion Baby” isn’t a cute Easter-egg — <strong>she’s a cosmic IOU.</strong><br>
      Sharon Rogers personifies the price of Steve’s happily-ever-after;<br>
      Doom arrives not as a villain, <strong>but as a collections agent demanding payment in full – and the collateral is a child who never asked to be born into a breaking multiverse.</strong></p>
