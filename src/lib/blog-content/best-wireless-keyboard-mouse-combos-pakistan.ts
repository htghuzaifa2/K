      <h2>🔋 Best Wireless Keyboard + Mouse Combos for Home Office in Pakistan (2025)</h2>
      <p>A guide focused on productivity, ergonomics, connectivity (Bluetooth vs 2.4GHz dongle), battery life, and local price/value for remote workers in Pakistan.</p>
      
      <h2>Why this matters for Pakistani remote workers</h2>
      <p>Your keyboard and mouse are your daily tools — not flashy toys. A good wireless combo gives you cable-free comfort, fewer distractions on calls, and cleaner desk posture. In Pakistan, where many of us work from small desks and shared spaces, the right combo can improve focus and reduce fatigue.</p>
      
      <h3>Quick price map (local examples)</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>Budget combos often sit between ₨3,000–8,000 on local marketplaces.</li>
        <li>Trusted mid-range Logitech combos commonly list around ₨6,000–12,000 at local stores.</li>
        <li>Premium office/multi-device combos (Logitech MX series) can be ₨33,000–60,000 in local official stores.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>What to prioritise when choosing a combo</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> 2.4GHz dongle (reliable, plug-and-forget) vs Bluetooth (no dongle, multi-device). If you switch between laptop and phone/tablet, Bluetooth or multi-device pairing helps.</li>
        <li><strong>Ergonomics:</strong> Low-profile keys, palm rest, sculpted mouse shape — small differences add up over long workdays.</li>
        <li><strong>Battery life:</strong> Look for months (or up to a year) on keyboard batteries and weeks to months on mouse — rechargeable options are convenient.</li>
        <li><strong>Layout & keys:</strong> Full-size with numpad vs TKL (tenkeyless) — choose based on whether you use the number pad.</li>
        <li><strong>Local warranty & support:</strong> Cheaper parallel imports save cash but official distributors save headaches for replacements/repairs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Connectivity & battery tips (local realities)</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li><strong>2.4GHz dongle:</strong> best for low-latency typing/scrolling and shared workstations. If you often use the same PC, this is the simplest.</li>

        <li><strong>Battery life expectation:</strong> Budget membrane combos: months on one set of batteries; premium combos: weeks to months per charge.</li>
      </ul>
