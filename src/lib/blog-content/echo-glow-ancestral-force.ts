<h2>Echo’s Glow: What the Energy Around Maya Lopez’s Fist Really Means</h2>
      <p>Freeze-frame the leaked BTS photo and you’ll see amber-orange spirals pulsing outward from Maya’s palm — not Phoenix fire, not Celestial blue, but something older and earth-bound.</p>
      <h3>🌪️ The Power Source – Choctaw Ancestral Force</h3>
      <p>Show canon: Echo (2024) retcons Maya’s “photographic reflexes” into mystical heritage — orange spiral glyphs appear on her hands when she channels her ancestors.</p>
      <p>Function: Superhuman strength, limited healing, and concussive energy bursts — tactile, not cosmic.</p>
      <p>Translation: the on-set glow is the same ancestral force, amped up for Doomsday — a spiritual battery, not a cosmic host.</p>
      <h3>🔥 Phoenix Force? Orange ≠ Cosmic</h3>
      <p>Color mismatch: Phoenix = crimson-red or white-hot; Maya’s glow is amber, the exact shade of her Choctaw spiral.</p>
      <p>Behavior mismatch: Phoenix manifests as fire; Maya’s energy is contained inside her palm, never engulfs her body.</p>
      <p>Writer quote: “We’re playing with the idea of Phoenix — life, death, rebirth — but rooted in the soil, not the stars”.</p>
      <p>Conclusion: homage, not host — a thematic nod, not a possession.</p>
      <h3>🌍 Celestial or Vibranium? Too Grounded</h3>
      <p>No blue-white Celestial lattice, no Wakandan pulse pattern — glow is warm, organic, hand-sized.</p>
      <p>Vibranium theory debunked: Living Vibranium (from Echo Chamber caves) is violet and environmental; Maya’s power is body-bound.</p>
      <h3>🎯 Bottom Line</h3>
      <p>Echo’s glow is ancestral, not alien — a spiritual amplifier that turns Maya into a living conduit of her people’s strength.<br>In Doomsday, expect her to punch holes in Incursion walls — not with cosmic fire, but with the fist of every ancestor who ever protected the land.</p>
