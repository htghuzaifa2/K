<h2>Fatherhood as Power</h2>
      <p>Thor’s plea – “let me remain… to see my love once more” – isn’t romantic nostalgia; it’s a cosmic power-source.<br>
      The “Love” he’s begging to see isn’t Jane alone – it’s his adopted daughter, Love, the child he literally plucked from the heart of Eternity at the end of Love and Thunder.<br>
      In Doomsday that paternal bond becomes a living battery against Doctor Doom’s reality-editing tyranny.</p>
      <h3>1. Who (or What) Is Love?</h3>
      <p>Origin: Born when Thor shared the Heart of Eternity with Gorr’s dying daughter – a new being forged from omnipotent affection.</p>
      <p>Power set:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>Embodiment of affection/empathy across the multiverse.</li>
        <li>Can open star-gates of pure benevolence (on-screen in Love and Thunder finale).</li>
        <li>Ageless – exists outside linear time, appears 8-10 eternally.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Translation: she’s a person-shaped infinity stone – affection given flesh.</p>
      <h3>2. Why Thor’s Prayer Is Really “Let Me See Love Again”</h3>
      <p>Line parse: “my Love” (capital L) – Marvel scripts use capitals for entities, lower-case for feelings.</p>
      <p>Emotional math:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>Jane = mortal anchor (romantic love).</li>
        <li>Love = cosmic anchor (paternal love).</li>
        <li>Prayer fuses both – if Thor dies, the multiverse loses its only conduit to the literal force of Love.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>3. Love vs. Doom – A Cosmic Chess Piece</h3>
      <div class="overflow-x-auto">
        <table class="min-w-full border-collapse border border-border">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th class="border border-border p-2 text-left">Love (Eternity’s heart)</th>
              <th class="border border-border p-2 text-left">Doom (Battleworld architect)</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">Power of affection – unites realities</td>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">Power of control – erases realities</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">Exists outside time – can’t be pruned</td>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">Needs linear control – prunes timelines</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">Weapon = empathy blast – weakens ego</td>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">Weapon = ego – feeds on control</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p class="mt-2">Battlefield scenario: Doom prepares to snip the timeline thread; Love appears, opens a star-gate of pure affection – Doom hesitates for a nanosecond (his mother-issue), giving Thor the opening to strike.</p>
      <h3>4. Story Function in Doomsday</h3>
      <p>MacGuffin: Doom needs to bottle Love to stabilize Battleworld’s emotions – without affection, the patchwork planet collapses into civil war.</p>
      <p>Stakes: Thor must choose – save his daughter OR let Doom weaponize her – fatherhood becomes the moral crucible of the film.</p>
      <p>Pay-off: Thor’s prayer is answered – Love arrives, but only after he admits unworthiness – paternal humility = cosmic key.</p>
      <h3>5. Meta Significance – Marvel’s New Infinity</h3>
      <p>Infinity Stones = gone; Love = emotional infinity – a force that can’t be snapped, stolen, or replicated.</p>
      <p>Franchise future: Love can cameo in any franchise – a child who hugs away multiversal trauma – the MCU’s living reset button.</p>
      <p>Bottom line: Thor’s motivation isn’t romantic longing – <strong>it’s cosmic fatherhood.</strong><br>
      Love isn’t his weakness – she’s the multiverse’s last infinity stone, <strong>and the only one that runs on hug energy instead of hubris.</strong></p>
