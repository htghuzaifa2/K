<h2>Costume Deep-Dive: What Sadie Sink’s Brand New Day Wardrobe Reveals About Her Villain</h2>
      <p>The first on-set images show Sink bundled in a yellow puffer jacket, military-camo pants, and combat boots, with fiery red hair spilling out. That combo isn’t random — it’s a breadcrumb trail pointing straight to Shathra, the Spider-Wasp, and away from a Jean Grey misdirect.</p>
      <h3>1️⃣ Color Palette – Yellow = Wasp Warning</h3>
      <p>Jean Grey = deep scarlet or X-green; Shathra’s comic palette is ochre yellow + charcoal black — exactly the jacket hue seen on set.</p>
      <p>Yellow is aposematic in nature — “I’m toxic, stay back” — fitting a villain who weaponizes attraction.</p>
      <h3>2️⃣ Fabric Texture – Organic, Not Armor</h3>
      <p>Puffer ridges mimic exoskeleton plating without going full cosplay suit; understated chitin = shapeshifter who doesn’t need metal.</p>
      <p>No X-logo piping, no leather Phoenix sash — deliberately grounded so when she shifts into wasp-form the contrast is horrifying.</p>
      <h3>3️⃣ Hair as Prop – Shapeshifter Tell</h3>
      <p>Sink told EW: “A lot of people forget that hair colour can change” — not a dye joke, a power hint.</p>
      <p>Comic Shathra morphs from red-haired woman to wasp-queen — hair is the first limb to mutate.</p>
      <p>Jean Grey never alters hair mid-fight; Shathra uses it as a visual stinger.</p>
      <h3>4️⃣ Military Silhouette – Hunter, Not Soldier</h3>
      <p>Cargo pockets & combat boots = field operative, not X-Men trainee.</p>
      <p>Shathra’s lore: cosmic entomologist who hunts Spider-Totems — the fatigues are hunting gear, not uniform.</p>
      <h3>5️⃣ Villain Confirmation – Trailer Audio</h3>
      <p>Leaked line: “You’re a mess, Spider-Man… it won’t just be your friends who don’t remember Peter Parker” — mind-warp + identity erasure = Shathra’s dream-venom.</p>
      <p>No Phoenix echo, no “Omega-level” name-drop — power set is psionic infection, not telekinetic force.</p>
      <h3>🎯 Bottom Line</h3>
      <p>Yellow jacket = wasp warning, camo = hunter, red hair = morphing prop, trailer audio = identity vampire.<br>Every pixel screams Shathra, whispers “not Jean”, and sets up the MCU’s first villain who weaponizes Peter Parker’s greatest fear — being forgotten.</p>
