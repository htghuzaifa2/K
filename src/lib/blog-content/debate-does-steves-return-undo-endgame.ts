<h2>Debate: Does Steve’s Return + Baby Undo Endgame?</h2>
      <h3>🔥 The Fan Split – Two Emotional Camps</h3>
      <div class="overflow-x-auto">
        <table class="min-w-full border-collapse border border-border">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th class="border border-border p-2 text-left">“You Ruined Perfection!”</th>

            <tr>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">Endgame gave Steve a silent, circular farewell – no death, no sacrifice, just a dance and a shield hand-off. Adding a cradle feels like graffiti on the Mona Lisa.</td>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">Russo canon: Steve branched, didn’t die, didn’t break main timeline – Marvel kept the lock unlatched so they could walk back through.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">Core gripe: Sam’s moment is hijacked – the first teaser spotlights Steve’s diaper duty, not Sam’s leadership – audience sentiment re-centers on the 1940s icon.</td>

      <h3 class="mt-4">⚖️ Risk 1 – Nostalgia Overdose</h3>
      <p>Short-term win: casual audiences flock to familiar faces – box-office safety net after Quantumania under-performance.</p>
      <p>Long-term loss: new Avengers (Sam, Kate, Riri) remain supporting acts – their billion-dollar film never arrives because marketing keeps propping up retirees.</p>
      <p>Paradox: <strong>the more Steve succeeds, the less incentive Marvel has to elevate successors – a self-fulfilling nostalgia loop.</strong></p>
      <h3>🛡️ Defense – Respect for Sam Isn’t Erased, It’s Delayed</h3>
      <p>Canon intact: Sam still carries the shield, still headlines Captain America: Brave New World – <strong>Steve’s arc is alternate-timeline side-quest, not main-timeline overwrite.</strong></p>
      <p>Thematic mirror: <strong>Steve’s fatherhood guilt </strong>parallels Sam’s leadership burden – both men pay for the mantle in different centuries – thematic balance, not replacement.</p>
      <h3>🎬 Marketing Reality – Nostalgia Is the Bridge, Not the Destination</h3>
      <p>Trailer order: Steve (nostalgia hook) → Thor (cosmic epic) → Doom (villain hype) → ensemble – <strong>legacy opens the door, new blood walks through it.</strong></p>
      <p>Pay-off promise: rumored finale hands narrative baton back to Sam & co. – <strong>Steve’s sacrifice redeems his 1945 selfishness, freeing the next gen to own the future.</strong></p>
      <h3>🎯 Bottom Line</h3>
      <p>Steve’s return risks nostalgia overdose, but it doesn’t erase Sam’s title – it delays his spotlight so the torch-pass feels earned, not rushed.<br>
      <strong>The baby isn’t undoing Endgame – it’s charging the emotional battery that </strong>will power Sam’s true coronation when the multiverse dust settles.</strong></p>
