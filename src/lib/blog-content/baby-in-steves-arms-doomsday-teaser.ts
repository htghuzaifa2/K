<h2>The Baby in Steve’s Arms: Whose Child Is It in the Doomsday Teaser?</h2>
      <p>A single, soft-focus shot — Steve Rogers cradling an infant while a piano rendition of the Avengers theme swells — has ignited three multiverse-level theories. Let’s break them down and see which one holds the most narrative weight.</p>
      <h3>1️⃣ Sharon Rogers – The Canonical Daughter</h3>
      <p>Origin: Earth-415 (Marvel Future Fight & Secret Wars tie-ins) – daughter of Steve & Peggy in a timeline where Steve was never frozen.</p>
      <p>MCU Fit:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>Teaser shows Steve living in the past post-Endgame — exactly the “never-frozen” branch that births Sharon.</li>
        <li>Star-Light Armor & Holo-Shield (designed by Stark) give Marvel toyetic armor + a third Captain America for Phase 7.</li>
        <li>Leaked Dialogue Support: “You’re a mess, Spider-Man” (Shathra’s line) is rumored to be spoken while Sharon (as new Cap) fights Peter — passing the torch via combat.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Probability: Highest — bloodline + mantle + merch = perfect MCU synergy.</p>
      <h3>2️⃣ Reincarnated Peggy Carter – The Romantic Loop</h3>
      <p>Theory: Soul Stone energy (from Steve’s return trip) rebinds Peggy’s soul into newborn flesh — eternal love made literal.</p>
      <p>Visual Clue: Steve stares at his old uniform first, then softens when he sees the baby — “Peggy, reborn” interpretation.</p>
      <p>Narrative Problem: Reincarnation without memory = stranger, not lover; MCU rarely erases emotional closure that cleanly.</p>
      <p>Probability: Low — poetic, but creepy and nullifies Peggy’s Endgame farewell.</p>
      <h3>3️⃣ Young Kang Variant – The Time-Refugee</h3>
      <p>Theory: <strong>Steve finds a “pruned” baby Kang (maybe Victor Timely) and swears to raise him away from Doom’s influence — Thanos-level stakes in a cradle.</strong></p>
      <p>Evidence:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>Doomsday leaks mention Doom hunting “anchor babies” across timelines.</li>
        <li>Steve’s arc becomes atonement — his 1945 stay created the branch that allowed Kang to survive.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Counter: No leaked set photos of Kang infant prosthetics; Russo secrecy usually hides bigger twists than a baby.</p>
      <p>Probability: Medium — thematically juicy, but requires heavy exposition in an already crowded film.</p>
      <h3>🎯 Bottom Line</h3>
      <p>Sharon Rogers ticks every box:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>Comic precedent ✅</li>
        <li>Timeline match ✅</li>
        <li>Merch-friendly third Cap ✅</li>
        <li>Actress-ready (no casting leak yet, but open slot for 2027 Phase 7 slate) ✅</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The baby isn’t just a baby — it’s Steve’s second chance at fatherhood and Marvel’s first biological heir to the shield.<br>When Doomsday hits, don’t expect a cradle — expect a star-spangled legacy crawling straight into Secret Wars.</p>
