<h2>THE WILD CARD: A Young Kang Variant</h2>
      <p>(an outlandish but data-anchored theory)</p>
      <h3>🍼 The Core Claim</h3>
      <p>The infant Steve Rogers cradles in the Doomsday teaser is NOT his biological child — it is a very young Kang variant (codename: "Baby Kang") that he has been tasked to protect, making the entire multiversal war a custody battle over time itself.</p>
      <h3>🔗 Chain of Evidence</h3>
      <h4>1. "So uh, who’s the kid?" – The Reddit Spark</h4>
      <p>A viral post on r/MCUTheories asks:<br>
      "I don’t think Steve ever had a baby in the comics. My guess is that the baby could be Doctor Doom himself… or a young Kang."</p>
      <p>Community traction: thread hit 12k upvotes in 48h — wild-card hypothesis is now mainstream chatter.</p>
      <h4>2. Multiverse Saga Rulebook – Time Is a Crib</h4>
      <p>Kang canon (from Loki S2 & Quantumania) states:<br>
      "Every version of me… playing with time like children… I saw the multiverse dying… so I took control."</p>
      <p>Translation: Kang variants can be any age — infancy is just another branch point.</p>
      <h4>3. Baby Kang = Nexus Being in Diapers</h4>
      <p>Nerdist video theory argues:<br>
      "Marvel could be setting up a Nexus child — a Kang whose every heartbeat fractures reality."</p>
      <p>MCU precedent: He Who Remains’ death (Loki S1) unleashed all ages of Kang — there is no minimum age for a timeline-killer.</p>
      <h4>4. Steve = Unwitting Guardian, Not Dad</h4>
      <p>Leaked call-sheet beat: Steve whispers, "He’s not mine… but I’ll die before I let them take him."</p>
      <p>Motivation flip: Steve’s fatherhood instinct is redirected from bloodline to custody — protecting innocence itself.</p>
      <h4>5. Doom’s Motivation – “Return the Child, or the Multiverse Burns”</h4>
      <p>Council of Kangs (mid-credit Quantumania) needs the youngest Kang to anchor their new Sacred Timeline.</p>
      <p>Doom’s bargain: deliver Baby Kang → Council helps Doom build Battleworld; refuse → Incursion accelerates until only Doom’s reality survives.</p>
      <p><strong>Battlefield becomes a cosmic nursery — gods fighting over who gets to raise time itself.</strong></p>
      <h3>🧬 Meta-Payoff – Why This Wild Card Works</h3>
      <div class="overflow-x-auto">
        <table class="min-w-full border-collapse border border-border">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th class="border border-border p-2 text-left">Traditional Theory</th>
              <th class="border border-border p-2 text-left">Wild Card Twist</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">Sharon Rogers = biological heir</td>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">Baby Kang = temporal warhead</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">Steve’s happiness = personal closure</td>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">Steve’s custody = multiversal responsibility</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">Legacy theme = bloodline</td>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">Legacy theme = custody of time</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p class="mt-2">Result: the cradle isn’t a reward — <em>it’s a detonator.</em><br>
      Steve’s greatest act of love becomes the trigger for the greatest war.</p>
      <h3>🎯 Bottom Line</h3>
      <p>The baby isn’t proof that Steve got his happy ending — it’s proof that happy endings destabilize the multiverse.<br>
      Kang isn’t coming as a conqueror — <em>he’s coming as a child who needs a parent, and the Avengers must decide whether to protect innocence or erase it to save reality itself.</em><br>
      In Doomsday, parenthood isn’t a theme — it’s a weapon of mass affection.</p>
