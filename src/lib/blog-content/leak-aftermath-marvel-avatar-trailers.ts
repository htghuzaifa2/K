export default `<h2>Leak After-math: Will Marvel Accelerate Its Avatar-Tied Trailers?</h2>
      <p>Short answer: Not yet — but the studio is pre-loading insurance in case the dominoes fall.</p>
      <h3>1. What We Know (Dec 19, 2025 snapshot)</h3>
      <p>Four different Doomsday teasers are locked to run only in front of Avatar: Fire and Ash for the next four weeks — a new one every Friday.</p>
      <p>No simultaneous online drop is scheduled; Disney is betting on theatrical scarcity to sell repeat tickets and delay the HD piracy clock.</p>
      <p>Each teaser is 1 min 27 s max, already rated overseas, so HD masters exist and could be flipped to YouTube within 90 min if leaks spike.</p>
      <h3>2. Contingency Triggers — Inside the Playbook</h3>

      <h3 class="mt-4">3. Why They’re Holding the Line (For Now)</h3>
      <p>Nolan precedent: The Odyssey 5-min IMAX preview never leaked in HD; Disney copies the model to re-train audiences that theatres = exclusives.</p>
      <p>Anti-piracy PSA plays seconds before each teaser — pre-shame recording tactic cuts leak attempts by ~35 % in early test screenings.</p>
      <p>Four-week drip = four news cycles; Marvel buys January headlines without spending extra media buy dollars.</p>
      <h3>4. Prediction — When the Switch Gets Flipped</h3>
      <p><strong>Safest bet</strong>: Trailer-2 (Dec 26) will be online 24 h after its cinema premiere — Christmas Day traffic is too lucrative to leave in cam-rip darkness.</p>
      <p>Wildcard: If Trailer-1 stays leak-free through Dec 22, Disney keeps the theatrical-only model intact until New Year’s, then drops a 4K super-cut to own the narrative heading into 2026.</p>
      <p>Bottom line: Marvel won’t move the schedule early unless piracy forces their hand — but every HD master is already sitting on a server with the upload button glowing green, waiting for the first phone to tilt sideways in a dark auditorium.</p>
