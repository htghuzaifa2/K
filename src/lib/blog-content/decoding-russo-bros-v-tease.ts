<h2>Decoding the Russo Bros’ Cryptic “V” – Vision, Valeria, or the Void?</h2>
      <p>The Russos love a rorschach tease. Their latest Instagram drop — a black-and-white “V” — is already splitting the fandom into three camps. Let’s weigh each with the evidence that actually exists.</p>
      <h3>1️⃣ V = Vision (Paul Bettany)</h3>
      <p>Actor intel: Bettany told The Telegraph he has “Avengers duties next year” — widely read as Secret Wars pickups.</p>
      <p>Visual match: The angled, glowing edge of Vision’s forehead gem forms a perfect “V” when back-lit — the teaser’s high-contrast lighting could be a macro shot of the Mind-Stone facet.</p>
      <p>Story slot: VisionQuest (2026) ends with White Vision reassembling; Doomsday is the pay-off stage for that arc.</p>
      <p>Probability: High — actor confirmation + iconic silhouette = safest bet.</p>
      <h3>2️⃣ V = Valeria Richards – Doom’s Goddaughter</h3>
      <p>Comic canon: Valeria is Reed & Sue’s daughter, named by Doom himself, and his only emotional tether.</p>
      <p>MCU gateway: Fantastic Four (2025) introduces Vanessa Kirby’s Sue; a post-credit stinger already sets up pregnancy.</p>
      <p>Symbol logic: “V” = first letter of Valeria and Victor — a shared initial that mirrors their shared destiny in One World Under Doom.</p>
      <p>Narrative function: Doom’s soft spot — kidnapping Valeria becomes the Fantastic Four’s leverage in Doomsday.</p>
      <p>Probability: Medium — perfect emotional bomb, but no casting leak yet.</p>
      <h3>3️⃣ V = the Void (End of Time)</h3>
      <p>Loki lore: Yggdrasil branches were drawn as two diverging lines in Loki S1; the teaser’s darkened left branch = corrupted timeline.</p>
      <p>Story hook: Steve Rogers’ 1945 branch is the nexus that starts the Incursion; the Void is where pruned realities (Fox-X-Men, etc.) bleed into Battleworld.</p>
      <p>Visual cue: “V” = fork in the multiverse road — Sacred Timeline vs. Doom-approved timeline.</p>
      <p>Probability: Medium-High — meta-narrative gold, but less character-driven.</p>
      <h3>🎯 Bottom Line</h3>
      <p>Vision has actor confirmation and iconography on his side.<br>Valeria gives Doom emotional stakes.<br>The Void turns multiversal mechanics into marketing art.<br>Most likely hybrid: The “V” is Yggdrasil’s split — Vision will emerge from the corrupted branch to guide heroes through the Void, while Valeria becomes the human bargaining chip that forces Reed to confront Doom’s humanity.<br>One symbol, three layers — exactly the kind of Russian-doll tease the Russos live for.</p>
