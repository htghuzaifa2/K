<h2>Fractured Timeline Map: What the Doomsday Set Prop Reveals About Incursion Zones</h2>
      <p>A weather-beaten, parchment-style map — dotted with crimson fissures and Na’vi-blue energy veins — was photographed on a Doomsday sound-stage.<br>Each fracture line is labeled with Earth-designations and collision countdowns.<br>Here’s the guided tour of which realities are on a collision course and why the Fox-X-Men Earth is ground-zero.</p>
      <h3>🌍 Zone-A: Earth-10005 (Fox-X-Men) – The Red Line</h3>
      <p>Label on map: “E-10005 – Anchor Breach – T-12 Sol Rotations”</p>
      <p>Monica Rambeau GPS: The Marvels post-credit placed her inside this universe — her foreign mass triggers the physics countdown.</p>
      <p>Iconography on prop: Wolverine claw scratches form the border — subtle confirmation that this is the universe Fox built (2000-2020 films).</p>
      <p>Collision vector: MCU-616 is guilty Earth (Time-Heist damage); Earth-10005 is innocent collateral — sympathy splits Avengers vs. X-Men.</p>
      <h3>🕷️ Zone-B: Earth-96283 (Raimi-Verse) – The Web-Fissure</h3>
      <p>Map glyph: Spider-symbol cracked in half — Sam Raimi’s font used for “E-96283” label.</p>
      <p>Leaked audio: “I’m nothing without the suit” echo in desert Void set — Tobey Maguire’s voice line sampled for echo effect.</p>
      <p>Incursion role: Smaller fracture, secondary collision — Peter-2 may cameo as refugee rather than main combatant.</p>
      <h3>🧬 Zone-C: Earth-1218 (Our Earth) – The Mirror Crack</h3>
      <p>Prop detail: Map’s bottom corner shows a photo-negative Earth labeled “E-1218 – Prime Observer” — the screen-watcher reality.</p>
      <p>Meta function: Doom’s final move is to collapse even the audience’s world — fourth-wall breach sets up Secret Wars’ “every universe ever published” mantra.</p>
      <h3>⚡ Zone-D: Krakoa Pocket – The Green Oasis</h3>
      <p>Map icon: Four-leaf clover inside a shield — Krakoa’s gates are the only stable zone; mutants open borders to refugees from dying Earths.</p>
      <p>Story utility: Hospital/refugee camp scenes will be shot on Krakoa sets — emotional safe-space before Doom razes it.</p>
      <h3>🧨 Doom’s Signature – The Central Vortex</h3>
      <p>Center of map: A stylized “V” (same symbol Russo Bros teased) — Doom’s crest overlaid on the collision nexus.</p>
      <p>Translation: He isn’t stopping the crash — he’s steering it, deciding which realities deserve survival inside his Battleworld patchwork.</p>
      <h3>🎯 Take-Away</h3>
      <p>The prop is Battleworld’s blueprint:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>Fox-X-Men Earth = emotional anchor (audience sympathy).</li>
        <li>Raimi-Verse = nostalgia spice.</li>
        <li>Krakoa = moral safe-space to be burned down for stakes.</li>
        <li>Doom’s “V” = editor’s scalpel — cut, keep, delete at his whim.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Incursion isn’t random — it’s curated.<br>And the map proves Doom is already holding the pen.</p>
