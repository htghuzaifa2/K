      <h2>🚀 Freelance Marketplaces for Pakistani Web Developers: How to Get Clients in 2026</h2>
      <p>In 2026, freelancing in Pakistan is a full-fledged career. With digital transformation and remote work trends, web developers in Pakistan have more opportunities than ever to work with clients both locally and internationally. But to stand out, you need to know where to find clients, how to price your work, and how to deliver professionally.</p>
      
      <h2>🌐 Top Freelance Platforms for Pakistani Web Developers</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li><strong>Upwork:</strong> A huge global marketplace. Start with small, well-rated projects to build your reputation.</li>
        <li><strong>Fiverr:</strong> Perfect for beginners. Create "gigs" for specific services, like "I will design a responsive WordPress website."</li>
        <li><strong>Toptal & Guru:</strong> Premium platforms for experienced developers (3+ years) that offer higher pay.</li>

      <h2>💼 How to Present Your Portfolio</h2>
      <p>Your portfolio is your resume and proof of skill. Include live links, screenshots, GitHub links, and short case studies (problem → solution → result). Host it on your own domain for professionalism.</p>
      
      <h2>💵 Pricing: PKR vs USD</h2>

        <li><strong>Wise:</strong> Good for direct USD transfers.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Bank Transfers:</strong> For domestic clients only.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Always take a 50% advance payment before starting custom projects.</p>
      
      <h2>⏰ Deliverables & Client Management</h2>
      <p>To maintain a professional image, share project timelines, use tools like Trello for progress tracking, and communicate professionally via email or Slack. Offering maintenance packages can create a steady income source.</p>
      
      <h2>✨ Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>Freelancing success isn’t about luck—it’s about building trust. Show your work, price confidently, deliver on time, and maintain strong client relationships. Pakistan’s tech talent is world-class; it’s time to showcase it globally.</p>
