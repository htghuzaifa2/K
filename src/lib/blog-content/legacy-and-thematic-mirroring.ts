<h2>Legacy & Thematic Mirroring – How One Crib Unites Three old Avengers</h2>
      <h3>Thesis: Avengers: Doomsday is not a war for universes—it is a war for parenthood.</h3>
      <p>Steve’s cradle, Thor’s prayer, and Doom’s empty arms form a triptych of legacy that turns the multiverse into a global custody battle.</p>
      <h3>1. Steve Rogers – The Father Who Created Life</h3>
      <p>Act: chose to stay in 1945, fathered Sharon Rogers – a biological heir born of personal happiness.</p>
      <p>Moral paradox: his love created a timeline; that timeline’s existence now threatens trillions.</p>
      <p>Legacy question: “Is it fair to save my child if the cost is everyone else’s?”</p>
      <h3>2. Thor Odinson – The Father Who Fights for Life</h3>
      <p>Act: prays in the forest – “let the thread lengthen… to see my Love once more” – begging for more time with his daughter, Love (Eternity’s embodiment).</p>
      <p>Moral paradox: his power can’t protect her; he must beg instead of command.</p>
      <p>Legacy question: “Am I still a god if I can’t guard my own child?”</p>
      <h3>3. Doctor Doom – The Father Who Lost Life</h3>
      <p>Reported motive: his home reality (Earth-Latveria) crumbles because Steve’s timeline appeared – his family vanishes in the collapse.</p>
      <p>Act: seizes the Incursion to build Battleworld – a nursery where only his people survive.</p>
      <p>Moral paradox: “If I can’t have my child, no one gets theirs.”</p>
      <p>Triangular conflict:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>Steve = Creator</li>
        <li>Thor = Protector</li>
        <li>Doom = Eraser</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All three wield cosmic power, but their battlefield is the cradle.</p>
      <h3>4. The Baby as Thematic MacGuffin</h3>
      <div class="overflow-x-auto">
        <table class="min-w-full border-collapse border border-border">

          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p class="mt-2">The multiverse is just the playground – <strong>the real prize is the right to raise the next generation.</strong></p>
      <h3>5. Pay-off – Battleworld as Global Nursery</h3>
      <p>Doom’s decree: “Only children born under my sky will see sunrise.”</p>
      <p>Steve’s counter: “Then we fight for the right to choose our children’s sky.”</p>
      <p>Thor’s resolution: “I will surrender my thunder if it buys my daughter one more dawn.”</p>
      <p>Final image (rumored): three fathers standing in a circle, each holding a child’s hand, while galaxies collapse behind them – parenthood is the only infinity that survives the snap.</p>
      <h3>🎯 Bottom Line</h3>
      <p>Doomsday isn’t about who’s strongest – <strong>it’s about who’s </strong>willing to be last so their child can be first.<br>
      Steve creates life, Thor begs for life, Doom erases life – <strong>the multiverse war is a custody hearing where love itself is on trial.</strong></p>
