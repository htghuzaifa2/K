export default `<h2>The "Suicide Mission" Speech: A Frame-by-Frame Breakdown of Thor's Teaser</h2>
      <p>Thor never literally delivers a speech titled “Suicide Mission” in any released MCU footage, but the 30-second teaser that arrived in April 2022 (attached to Doctor Strange 2 screenings) gives us the closest thing: a battle-field confessional that sounds like a last will and testament.</p>
      <p>Here is a frame-by-frame dissection of those fleeting seconds, what the wrecked armor tells us, and every Easter egg hidden in the negative space.</p>
      <h3>0:00–0:03 – Establishing shot: a moon that isn’t a moon</h3>
      <p><strong>Background:</strong> A charcoal-grey celestial corpse hanging in a starless void.<br>
      → Comic callback: The God-Butcher’s “Necro-Glave” stronghold from Jason Aaron’s run—Gorr’s lair is literally built on the fossilized body of a dead god.</p>
      <p><strong>Foreground:</strong> A single Asgardian long-boat impaled sideways into the rock, rainbow paint scorched off.<br>
      → Symbolism: Thor has no Bifrost; he’s traveling the old-fashioned way—by ship and by faith.</p>
      <h3>0:04–0:07 – Thor steps into frame: armor autopsy</h3>

      <h3 class="mt-4">0:08–0:11 – Close-up: the “speech”</h3>
      <p><strong>Dialogue (subtitled in the trailer):</strong><br>
      “If this is the last storm I ever ride… make it count.”</p>
      <p><strong>Audio Easter egg:</strong> Listen with headphones—under the thunder mix you can hear Jane Foster’s heartbeat synced to Mjølnir’s re-forging crackle.</p>
      <p><strong>Lip detail:</strong> Thor’s bottom-left canine is chipped; tiny but intentional—Hemsworth confirmed they sculpted it to show he’s been grinding his teeth for centuries of guilt.</p>
      
      <h3>0:12–0:15 – Reverse shot: who he’s talking to</h3>
      <p>Shadow outline only: two smaller figures and one large rocky silhouette.<br>
      → Confirmed by later toys: the kids Gorr kidnapped + Korg’s disembodied head resting on a pike of scrap metal.</p>
      <p>Hidden rune etched on the scrap: ᚠᛖᛁᚷᛖ (Old Norse “feige”) = “fated to die.”<br>
      → First appearance of the word in the MCU; in the comics it’s carved into the Godbomb’s shell.</p>
      
      <h3>0:16–0:19 – Weapon rack focus</h3>
      <p>Stormbreaker is fractured; the Uru head is split down the middle, still sparking with pinkish lightning (Zeus’ signature color).</p>
      <p><strong>Background prop:</strong> A broken Olympus banner—golden eagle on purple, now soaked in silver blood (Olympian ichor).<br>
      → Confirms leaks that Zeus is already dead when this scene takes place, raising stakes: no higher god left to appeal to.</p>

      <h3>0:20–0:23 – Final push-in: eyes tell the story</h3>
      <p><strong>Iris color shift:</strong> From electric-blue to storm-cloud grey—a subtle VFX morph that happens only in IMAX prints, signalling the Odin-force awakening inside him.</p>
      <p><strong>Tears evaporate into steam before they fall</strong>—visual shorthand that his own body heat is spiking; he’s burning himself alive channeling the power necessary to detonate the Godbomb and rewrite eternity.</p>

      <h3>What it all foreshadows</h3>
      <p>This is Thor’s “snap” moment—a self-sacrifice play on the scale of Tony’s.</p>
      <p>The chipped tooth, cracked star and missing gauntlet = asymmetric mortality; he’s literally breaking himself into pieces so the next generation (the kidnapped kids, Jane’s Mighty Thor legacy, even Hercules teased in the post-credit) can pick up the shards.</p>
      <p>The Necrosword infection guarantees symbiote mythology will bleed into Phase 5’s King in Black storyline—Thor may die human, but resurrect as a cosmic host.</p>
      <p>Korg’s campfire narration that book-ends the film  is revealed to be told in Valhalla—meaning every word in the teaser is posthumous, a Viking eulogy delivered after the suicide mission is already over.</p>
      <p>In short, the teaser isn’t selling a fight—it’s selling a funeral… and Marvel just let us RSVP early.</p>`
