<h2>The Animated Variant – Why Thor Was Recast for Marvel Zombies & What It Tells Us About Multiverse "Rules"</h2>
      <p>🚨 Headline: Chris Hemsworth OUT, Greg Furman IN – and it’s not about the mic.</p>
      <h3>1. The Recast Roster</h3>
      <p>Seven live-action MCU actors were swapped for Marvel Zombies voice duty:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>Thor → Greg Furman</li>
        <li>Spider-Man → Hudson Thames</li>
        <li>Okoye → Kenna Ramsey</li>
        <li>Wenwu → Feodor Chin</li>
        <li>Zemo → Rama Vallury</li>
        <li>Melina → Kari Wahlgren</li>
        <li>Blade → Todd Williams</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Hemsworth had already voiced Thor in What If...? – so medium isn’t the barrier; logistics & economics are.</p>
      <h3>2. Why Hemsworth Was Passed Over</h3>
      <p>Scheduling clash: Avengers: Doomsday was filming in London during Zombies ADR windows – voice sessions require 4-6 half-days; Hemsworth couldn’t leave set.</p>
      <p>Line count vs. star rate: Thor has < 30 seconds of dialogue across four episodes – paying A-list rates for a cameo broke the TV-MA animation budget.</p>
      <p>Creative freedom: Show-runner Bryan Andrews wanted “a different flavor of god” – a younger, hungrier voice to sell Thor’s shame arc (zombie PTSD → self-exile).</p>
      <h3>3. Multiverse "Rules" – Voice ≠ Canon Lock</h3>
      <p>Precedent set: What If...? kept 90 % of film actors – but Zombies proves Marvel will recast when:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>Schedule conflict</li>
        <li>Character is alternate (zombie, variant, cartoon)</li>
        <li>Cost-per-line is prohibitive</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Audience contract: Alternate timeline = alternate performance – fans accept the swap because it’s not the sacred 616 continuity.</p>
      <h3>4. What Makes Hemsworth the "Definitive" Thor Anyway?</h3>
      <p>Cultural osmosis: four solo films + four Avengers = 16 years of global iconography – no 90-second cartoon can dilute that brand.</p>
      <p>Physicality + comedy: Hemsworth’s improv timing (“Another!”, “Bring me Thanos!”) taught the world to laugh with a god – Furman mimics the cadence, but the baritone & biceps are irreplaceable.</p>
      <p>Meta promise: Hemsworth is already locked for Avengers: Doomsday – his voice will thunder again on the big screen, re-anchoring the real Thor in 2026.</p>
      <p>Bottom line: Marvel Zombies is a fun-house mirror – it shows us a Thor, not the Thor.<br>
      Hemsworth’s god isn’t replaced; <strong>he’s simply elsewhere, forging stormbreakers while Furman holds the zombie umbrella.</strong></p>
