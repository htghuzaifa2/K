<h2>"The Unworthy Son's Plea" – Line-by-Line Deconstruction</h2>
      <p>Leaked forest prayer (Doomsday teaser, Dec 2025)</p>
      <p>"Of all the crowns, the kingdoms, the pride, I ask for none.<br>
      Father, hear your son. I am not worthy of life, but still I beg you to let the thread lengthen.<br>
      Not for thunder, not for war… let me remain long enough to see my love once more."</p>
      <h3>1️⃣ "Of all the crowns, the kingdoms, the pride, I ask for none."</h3>
      <p>Crowns = Asgard’s throne, kingdoms = Nine Realms, pride = warrior’s swagger.</p>
      <p>Verdict: voluntary abdication — he renounces every status symbol that once defined him.</p>
      <p>Biblical echo: "What does it profit a man to gain the whole world…" — a god counting his trophies as worthless.</p>
      <h3>2️⃣ "Father, hear your son. I am not worthy of life, but still I beg you to let the thread lengthen."</h3>
      <p>"Father" = Odin, but also the Norns (weavers of fate) — the prayer is polytheistic, addressing the storm itself.</p>
      <p>"Thread" = Norse metaphor for lifespan — a direct plea to the Norns to extend his destiny, not to save the world, but to exist a little longer.</p>
      <p>"Not worthy of life" = culmination of a decade of failures:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>Failed to stop Thanos (Infinity War)</li>
        <li>Lost Asgard (Ragnarok)</li>
        <li>Watched Loki & Heimdall die (Endgame)</li>
        <li>Became “Lebowski Thor” — gluttony as grief</li>
      </ul>
      <p>He doesn’t ask for worthiness — he asks for time, accepting unworthiness as fact.</p>
      <h3>3️⃣ "Not for thunder, not for war… let me remain long enough to see my love once more."</h3>
      <p>"Thunder" = his birthright, "war" = his addiction — he swears off both.</p>
      <p>"Love" = Jane (confirmed by FandomWire synopsis) — the only anchor left after losing brother, mother, father, home.</p>
      <p>Shift from savior to supplicant: no grand cause, just a man begging for one more sunset with his person.</p>
      <h3>🧬 Who Is He Praying To?</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>Odin – the immediate father, source of worthiness lessons.</li>
        <li>The Norns – weavers of the thread; lengthening fate is their domain.</li>
        <li>The Storm Itself – pantheistic turn: Thor addresses the phenomenon that birthed him, not a personified god.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Result: a trinitarian plea – dad, destiny, and the storm – all asked to delay the snip of cosmic scissors.</p>
      <h3>🎭 What the Prayer Signals for Doomsday</h3>
      <p>Tone shift: comedic thunder-god → penitent refugee – Russos repeat the Infinity War trick (silent Titan scene) but push further into vulnerability.</p>
      <p>Thematic spine: Doomsday is about control of fate; Thor’s surrender exposes the villain’s hubris – Doom demands threads, Thor begs for one more inch.</p>
      <p>Character stakes: if Thor survives, it won’t be because he’s worthy – it’ll be because he finally admitted he isn’t, and asked anyway.</p>
      <p>Bottom line: the prayer isn’t power-up dialogue – <strong>it’s a receipt of brokenness, a god counting his failures in real time, and hoping the universe still keeps a spare inch of thread for a fallen son who just wants to say goodbye.</strong></p>
