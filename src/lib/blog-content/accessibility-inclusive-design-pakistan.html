      <h2>🌍 Accessibility & Inclusive Web Design for Pakistani Users</h2>
      <p>Learn how Pakistani web developers can make the internet friendlier for everyone — from users with disabilities to low-bandwidth mobile visitors — by embracing accessibility, Urdu/English inclusivity, and responsible design.</p>
      
      <h2>💡 “Web for All” — More Than Just a Slogan</h2>
      <p>In Pakistan, the internet feels like a bazaar of voices. But not everyone experiences the web equally. Some can’t see it, some can’t hear it, and some can’t load it fast enough. That’s where you, the Pakistani web developer, step in — not just as a coder, but as a bridge builder.</p>
      
      <h2>🧭 What “Accessibility” Really Means</h2>
      <p>Accessibility means designing websites that everyone — regardless of ability, device, or internet speed — can use easily. In Pakistan, we also need to localize these ideas for our users, languages, and bandwidth realities.</p>
      
      <h2>♿ Accessibility in the Pakistani Context</h2>
      
      <h3>1. For Users with Disabilities</h3>
      <p>Over 27 million Pakistanis live with some form of disability. Here’s how to make your site work better for them:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>Add alt text to images.</li>
        <li>Use proper semantic HTML.</li>
        <li>Ensure sufficient color contrast.</li>
        <li>Make forms accessible with aria-labels.</li>
        <li>Ensure everything is navigable via keyboard.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>2. For Multilingual Users (Urdu & English)</h3>
      <p>Pakistan’s internet is beautifully bilingual. To cater to this:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>Use the HTML `lang` attribute (`lang="ur"` or `lang="en"`).</li>
        <li>Choose Urdu-friendly fonts like Noto Nastaliq Urdu.</li>
        <li>Add a simple language toggle button.</li>
        <li>Keep Urdu text right-aligned.</li>
        <li>Avoid using images that contain Urdu text.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>3. For Low-Bandwidth & Mobile Users</h3>
      <p>Many users in Pakistan rely on slow or limited mobile data. To help them:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>Compress images (use WebP).</li>
        <li>Lazy-load heavy content.</li>
        <li>Minify CSS & JS, and defer scripts.</li>
        <li>Cache assets with a Service Worker for offline support.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>💻 Developer’s Ethical Responsibility</h2>
      <p>Web developers in Pakistan are shaping the digital experience for millions. If we build only for the fastest phones and Wi-Fi, we leave most of the country out. By making sites light, local, and accessible, we build a Pakistan where every click counts.</p>
      
      <h2>🌺 The Poetic Close</h2>
      <p>The web isn’t just code — it’s connection. Every pixel you align, every form you fix, could open a door for someone who’s been locked out too long. Let your next project not just look beautiful — let it feel accessible.</p>
      <p class="italic">“Design not for the fastest hands, but for every heart that dares to click.” 💫</p>
