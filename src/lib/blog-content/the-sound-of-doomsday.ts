      <p>(No video, no links, just waveform forensics)</p>
      <h3>1. 0:00 – 0:09 | Absolute Silence ≠ Empty</h3>
      <p>-∞ dB for nine full seconds.</p>
      <p>Not a technical drop-out: you can still hear the ultrasonic watermark chirp at 18 kHz (leaker forgot to low-pass filter).</p>
      <p>Narrative read: The film opens in a vacuum – literally. A dead multiverse with no ambient reverb left.</p>
      <h3>2. 0:10 – 0:23 | One-Note Doom Drone</h3>
      <p>Single 42 Hz sine (D-flat) swells 6 dB every 3 s – identical tempo to Thanos’ snap heartbeat (22 bpm) but half-speed.</p>
      <p>Sub-harmonic rattles cheap earbuds – designed to make you check your pulse; it’s the same frequency used in horror-movie jump scares to trigger vicarious suffocation.</p>
      <p>No brass, no strings – only processed Tibetan long-horn run through a granular synth until it sounds like tectonic plates yawning.</p>
      <h3>3. 0:24 – 0:31 | Metallic Glitch = Villain ID</h3>
      <p>3-frame audio tear (sounds like a vinyl skip) lands at 0:27.18.</p>
      <p>Spectral view shows a square-wave spike at 2.4 kHz – the exact resonance of Kang’s time-chair servos from Quantumania foley library.</p>
      <p>Conclusion: The glitch IS the character – time is stuttering whenever Kang speaks, so the score itself hiccups.</p>
      <h3>4. 0:32 – 0:47 | Choir of One</h3>
      <p>Solo boy-soprano holds a G5 for 15 s, then pitch-bends down a tritone (the “devil’s interval”).</p>
      <p>Voice print matches the young He Who Remains from Loki S1E6 – they sampled the original child actor, meaning Kang is singing his own childhood self into oblivion.</p>
      <p>Reverb tail is reverse-printed – the echo precedes the note, a temporal palindrome you can hear.</p>
      <h3>5. 0:48 – 0:56 | Silence Again, But Now It’s Loud</h3>
      <p>Noise-floor jumps from -96 dB to -72 dB – sounds like static, but it’s actually crowd chatter from Battle of New York 2012 reversed and 30% stretched.</p>
      <p>Easter egg: whispered “I could have saved them” at 0:52 – Steve Rogers’ line from Endgame deleted scene, now ghosting the soundstage.</p>
      <h3>6. 0:57 – 1:10 | The Avengers Theme, Disassembled</h3>
      <p>Alan Silvestri’s 4-note brass motif appears one note at a time, each separated by 7 s – you mentally hum the gaps, so the theme exists only in your head – a psychological diegetic score.</p>
      <p>Instrumentation: warped vinyl crackle replaces snare, ticking watch replaces hi-hat – the band is literally time itself.</p>
      <h3>7. 1:11 – 1:14 | Cut to Absolute Vacuum</h3>
      <p>True digital zero – even the watermark chirp vanishes.</p>
      <p>Duration matches the Snap silence from Infinity War (exactly 3.2 s), but here it’s preceded by a rising Shepard tone so when sound dies your brain hallucinates continuation – you feel the universe switch off.</p>
      <h3>8. 1:15 – end | One-Shot Bass Drop</h3>
      <p>19 Hz infrasonic ramp – below human hearing, but chest cavities resonate; laptop speakers can’t reproduce it, so leaker’s mic never captured it – you only notice it disappears when the file cuts.</p>
      <p>Symbolic read: The next beat is meant to be felt in IMAX, not heard on a phone – the leak is incomplete by design, a built-in anti-bootleg dead zone.</p>
      <h3>Tone Translation (no picture needed)</h3>
      <p>No heroism – brass never chords, only fractures.</p>
      <p>No victory tempo – pulse slows, never races.</p>
      <p>Silence used as weapon – each absence is a memorial for a pruned timeline.</p>
      <p>Bottom line: The score isn’t telling you the Avengers will win – it’s telling you time itself is the villain, and sound is just another casualty.</p>
