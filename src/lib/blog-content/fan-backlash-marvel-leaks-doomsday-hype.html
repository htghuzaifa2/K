      <h3 class="mt-4">⚖️ Is the Backlash Killing the Hype?</h3>
      <p>The situation is more complex than simple hype erosion. Analysts and a portion of the audience see the strategy, leaks and all, as ultimately effective.</p>

      <p><strong>Generating Essential Buzz:</strong> After a period of perceived MCU stagnation, the leaks have made Doomsday the center of conversation. As noted in commentary on the leaks, "awful marketing is when it falls flat and nobody pays it attention. This is, quite clearly, the total opposite of that". The controversy itself is a form of engagement.</p>

      <p><strong>A Deliberate Nostalgia Play:</strong> Marvel is openly targeting the massive audience that loved Avengers: Endgame. The first marketing beats—Downey Jr. as Doom and Evans' return—are squarely aimed at them, not necessarily the fans of newer Phase 4 and 5 projects. The backlash from some is a calculated risk to secure a larger, more reliable global box office.</p>

      <p><strong>Strategic Long Game:</strong> The reported four-teaser plan suggests Marvel is playing a long game. Starting with a nostalgic hook (Steve Rogers) builds a foundation, with bigger, crowd-pleasing reveals (Thor, Doctor Doom, the full team) scheduled to roll out and ramp up excitement over time.</p>

      <p>In essence, the "backlash" may be a symptom of a marketing strategy that is purposefully polarizing to achieve maximum visibility. It has moved the discussion past apathy and into heated debate about the MCU's future, which for a tentpole film needing to dominate the cultural conversation, may be the primary goal.</p>
