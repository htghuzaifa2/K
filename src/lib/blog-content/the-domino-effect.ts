export default `<h2>THE DOMINO EFFECT</h2>
      <p>How the Avengers: Doomsday leaks could force Marvel to reshuffle, rewrite, or even shelve half of Phase 7.</p>
      <h3>1. What the Leaks Actually Say (December 2025)</h3>
      <p>Doctor Doom is not a one-film threat; the teaser audio confirms he “collapses the multiverse into a single, editable timeline” – a line that retcons every Disney+ show into optional canon.</p>
      <p>Young Avengers are introduced as the last survivors of pruned Earths, not Earth-616 natives.</p>
      <p>Armor Wars subplot is folded into Doomsday – Riri, Rhodey and Justin Hammer already appear in the Battleworld montage, meaning the stand-alone film is now a 45-minute section inside the Avengers epic.</p>

      <h3 class="mt-4">3. Story Dominoes – How One Scene Rewrites the Rest</h3>
      <h4>Armor Wars</h4>
      <p>Leak footage: Hammer drones painted with Doom’s mask sigil – the arms race is no longer about Stark tech, it’s about who gets to weaponize the multiverse collapse.</p>
      <p>Result: Marvel retires the “who stole the suits” mystery; Don Cheadle becomes permanent War Machine General for all Phase 7 team-ups.</p>
      <h4>Young Avengers</h4>
      <p>Early draft had them fight a “rookie Kang” – leak confirms that Kang is killed off-screen; the kids’ actual antagonist is Doom’s “Editorial Algorithm” (a living retcon code).</p>
      <p>Result: Kate Bishop, America Chavez, Cassie Lang are aged up via time-jump and introduced already battle-hardened – no origin stories needed, saving two hours of screen-time.</p>
      <h4>X-Men</h4>
      <p>Leak audio: Patrick Stewart’s Xavier says “We remember the world that was” – **mutants exist as “rememberers” immune to Doom’s memory wipe.</p>
      <p>Result: X-Men 2028 film is no longer a reboot – it’s “Phase 7 Reconstruction Chapter” where mutants help re-stitch reality after Secret Wars. Magneto becomes uneasy ally rather than villain.</p>

        </table>
      </div>
      <p class="mt-2">Armor Wars and Young Avengers no longer exist as separate tiles – their DNA is inside the Avengers films, and Phase 7 becomes the “Reconstruction Era” rather than another origin-phase.</p>
      <h3>5. Bottom Line</h3>
      <p>The Doomsday leaks didn’t just spoil twists – they exposed a multiverse reset so massive that any mid-tier stand-alone would feel trivial.</p>
      <p>Marvel’s Phase 7 is now post-apocalyptic Lego box: no origins, only rebuilds – and every domino falls toward one release date: December 18, 2026.</p>
