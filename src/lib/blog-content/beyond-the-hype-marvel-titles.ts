      <h3>1. DOOMSDAY – Not Just a Cool Word, a Blueprint for Reboot</h3>
      <p>In the 2015 Secret Wars comics, “Doomsday” is shorthand for the final incursion: two Earths crashing into each other until only Battleworld remains.</p>
      <p>The leaked Avengers: Doomsday teaser audio confirms the film will collapse every branching timeline into a single, Doctor Doom-edited continuum.</p>
      <p>Translation: the MCU is copy-pasting Hickman’s playbook—</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>Retire the old 616-saga continuity.</li>
        <li>Import alt-universe variants (Miles, MCU-X-Men, Fantastic Four) and declare “they’ve always been here.”</li>
        <li>Erase previous plot holes by writing them out of existence rather than explaining them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Expect new versions of dead icons (Stark, Romanoff, Rogers) to step out of the rebuilt ether once the dust settles—not multiverse visitors, but native inhabitants of the fresh Earth-Prime.</p>
      <h3>2. BRAND NEW DAY – Spider-Man’s Personal Big Bang</h3>
      <p>The comic arc was born from “One More Day”: Peter trades his marriage to Mephisto to save Aunt May, resetting 20 years of continuity.</p>
      <p>Sony’s Brand New Day film borrows the reset logic but swaps the devil for Doctor Strange’s memory spell:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>World already forgot Peter Parker exists (No Way Home).</li>
        <li>No magical deal required—the universe-wide mind-wipe IS his Mephisto bargain.</li>
        <li>Harry Osborn, Mr. Negative, Jackpot and other Brand-New-Day debuts can now walk into the MCU without origin baggage.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The title is not homage, it’s announcement: Spider-Man is the first franchise to live entirely inside the post-Doomsday reboot, serving as the audience POV for “What does a rewritten world feel like?”</p>
      <h3>3. Combined Signal – MCU 3.0’s Launch Protocol</h3>
      <div class="overflow-x-auto">
        <table class="min-w-full border-collapse border border-border">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th class="border border-border p-2 text-left">Phase 1-3</th>
              <th class="border border-border p-2 text-left">Phase 4-6 (Multiverse Saga)</th>
              <th class="border border-border p-2 text-left">Phase 7 ← You Are Here</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">Iron Man → Endgame 33-film arc</td>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">Multiverse cracks</td>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">Doomsday compresses multiverse → Brand New Day rewrites ground rules</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p class="mt-2">Doomsday = editorial sledgehammer</p>
      <p>Brand New Day = first issue of the new continuity</p>
      <p>Together the titles form Marvel’s mission statement:</p>
      <p>“We are done patching; we are reprinting.”</p>
      <h3>4. What It Means for Fans Going Forward</h3>
      <p>Canon is now opt-in: Events you love happened—or didn’t—depending on which shard of Battleworld you stand on.</p>
      <p>Entry-barrier demolished: New viewers can start with Brand New Day without 60 hours of homework; the film itself will dramatize the confusion and hand-hold the audience through the new status quo.</p>
      <p>Old favorites can re-enter without cheap resurrection; they’re native to the rebooted timeline, free of previous contracts or salaries.</p>
      <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
      <p>“Doomsday” is the eraser, “Brand New Day” is the first pencil stroke.</p>
      <p>Marvel isn’t teasing a fresh start—it’s titling it in bold capitals and asking you to swing along.</p>
