      <h3>🔍 Confirmed Details vs. Rumored Schedule</h3>
      <p><strong>What's Confirmed:</strong> The first minute-long teaser, focusing on Chris Evans' return as Steve Rogers, is confirmed to be playing in select theaters in front of Avatar: Fire and Ash. It also includes a 12-month countdown to the film's December 18, 2026 release date.</p>
      <p><strong>What's Reported:</strong> The four-week rollout strategy and the specific character focus of the subsequent teasers are widely reported by entertainment outlets like IGN and SuperHeroHype, based on insider information and earlier accurate leaks. As of now, Marvel has not officially announced this detailed schedule.</p>
      
      <h3>🎯 The Marketing Strategy</h3>
      <p>Analysts suggest this staggered, character-focused approach serves a specific purpose:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li><strong>Generating Repeat Viewings:</strong> Attaching a new teaser each week is seen as a tactic to encourage fans to see Avatar: Fire and Ash multiple times.</li>
        <li><strong>Re-engaging Audiences:</strong> By starting with familiar, beloved characters like Steve Rogers and Thor, Marvel aims to remind casual fans of the core Avengers and draw them back to the MCU.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>💻 When Will They Be Online?</h3>
      <p>It is currently unclear when Marvel will officially release these teasers online. The first Steve Rogers teaser was officially attached to Avatar screenings but was not immediately uploaded to Marvel's YouTube channel, though it quickly leaked online. The company may wait until the entire theatrical rollout is complete before releasing them digitally.</p>
