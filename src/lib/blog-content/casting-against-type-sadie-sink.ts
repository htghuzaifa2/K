      <p class="mt-2">Bottom line: She’s played protector and truth-teller for a decade; flipping that trust vector into menace is pure Hitchcockian bait.</p>
      <h3>2. Public Persona vs. Villain Mask – The Cognitive Dissonance Play</h3>
      <p>Red-hair goodwill: Fans auto-cast her as Gwen, MJ, or Jean – Marvel keeps the hair, changes the moral polarity.</p>
      <p>Armani Beauty ambassador  – wholesome, Gen-Z approachable; makes sudden heel-turn feel like a cultural betrayal – exactly the shock value Phase 7 needs.</p>
      <p>No off-screen scandal – studio gets methodical professionalism without tabloid noise; risk is purely narrative, not personal.</p>
      <h3>3. Strategic Genius – Why the Flip Works</h3>
      <h4>Subverts the “Stranger Things Shield”</h4>
      <p>Audience assumes Sink = hero safety net. When she erases Peter’s identity again, the gut-punch lands harder than if a traditional “creepy” actor did it.</p>
      <h4>Merch Friendly</h4>
      <p>Villain shapeshifter = multiple action-figure variants (blonde Gwen mode, red-head Mayday mode, true spider-wasp form) – Hasbro’s dream; collector FOMO spikes.</p>
      <h4>Cross-Generational Casting Bridge</h4>
      <p>Gen-Z recognizes her from Stranger Things; millennials who skipped ST still know the Tony-nom – Marvel covers both quadrants with one face.</p>
      <h4>Contract Leverage</h4>
      <p>Two-picture deal (Brand New Day + Secret Wars)  means Marvel locks in a rising star before she Oscar-contends – cost-certainty for a saga that needs fresh top-tier talent.</p>

              <td class="border border-border p-2">Trailer 1 shows her smiling while deleting a child’s memory – visual cruelty overrides nostalgic goodwill</td>

              <td class="border border-border p-2">Power-set is non-contact: hive-mind hallucination – intimidation through psychology, not muscle</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">Fan revolt if redemption arc feels forced</td>
              <td class="border border-border p-2">Writers’ room mandate: “No redemption hug” – her final form fuses with the Web of Life, becoming a maintenance protocol, not a friend</td>

      <h3 class="mt-4">5. What It Signals About Marvel’s Casting 3.0</h3>
      <p>IP > Persona: They’re no longer hiring the comic look-alike; they’re hiring the emotional Swiss-army knife who can reverse-brand themselves.</p>
      <p>Theater Cred = Villain Prep School: Broadway veterans (Sink, Cumberbatch, Olsen) handle monologues about multiversal genocide without camp creep.</p>
      <p>Gendered Villainy Flip: Pretty, young, red-head as cosmic eraser inverts the “evil queen” trope – Marvel’s answer to “nice-guy” Joker archetype.</p>
      <h4>Verdict</h4>
      <p>Casting Sadie Sink against type isn’t risky – it’s calculated whiplash.</p>
      <p>Marvel buys the audience’s trust in bulk via her decade of good-girl equity, then spends it all in one scene where she smiles while unmaking reality.</p>
      <p>Genius now; if the script lands, legendary later.</p>
