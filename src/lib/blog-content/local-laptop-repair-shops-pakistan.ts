      <h2>🔍 Do Local Laptop Repair Shops in Pakistan Actually Use Original Parts?</h2>
      <p>By the kimi.pk Team</p>
      <p>If you’re thinking of taking your laptop in for repair in Pakistan — maybe a battery replacement, screen fix or part swap — one big question looms: Are they using original parts or cheap substitutes? For students, developers, designers and remote workers, a non‑genuine part can mean reduced battery life, diminished performance or worse: further damage.</p>
      <p>Here’s a practical investigation of the landscape, what you should check, what many shops claim, and how you can protect yourself.</p>
      
      <h3>🛠️ What repair shops often say</h3>
      <p>Some reputable shops advertise “original and genuine parts”. For example:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>A Karachi shop claims: “We always use original and genuine parts… be careful with other repairing companies.”</li>
        <li>A parts‑supplier advertises “100% original laptop parts” and urges buyers to choose genuine.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So yes: some shops claim they use original parts. The question is: how consistent is that claim across the market?</p>
      
      <h3>🤔 What market reality & buyer reports suggest</h3>
      <p>On Reddit, Pakistani users report frustrations with cheap replacements and unclear parts:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>“The seller said that the new battery will give you only 1 hour backup … he said it was ‘A copy not the original’.”</li>
        <li>“Shopkeepers usually scam people by giving them fake parts or worse.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Many parts dealers list generic spares without clear brand/original certification. Example: a parts supplier offering laptop batteries & panels, but “original vs local ones” are both listed.</p>
      <p>Repair shops’ quotes and customer reviews often warn about “cheap imports” or substituted parts.</p>
      <p>So while there are shops using original parts, the risk of non‑genuine or refurbished parts is clearly present.</p>
      
      <h3>✅ How to check if parts are original or good quality</h3>
      <p>Here are some practical tips for Pakistani buyers:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li><strong>Ask for invoice/part number:</strong> When the shop replaces a battery/screen/board, ask for the part model and brand. A genuine Dell‑HP‑Lenovo original part will carry manufacturer markings.</li>
        <li><strong>Check warranty:</strong> Genuine parts usually come with local or at least short‑term warranty. If the shop offers “no warranty” or only a few days, be cautious.</li>
        <li><strong>Inspect the replaced part (if possible):</strong>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-4">
            <li><strong>Battery:</strong> Look for make, capacity, cycles (if it shows)</li>
            <li><strong>Screen:</strong> Check brand/manufacturer code, look for bright/clear panel</li>
            <li><strong>Motherboard/board parts:</strong> Look for clean soldering, no rework marks</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Test durability right away:</strong> After repair, use the laptop for a few hours and watch for anomalies (shorter battery life, odd fan behaviour, flickering screen).</li>
        <li><strong>Compare price vs part cost:</strong> If the quote is very low compared to genuine part cost, either the repair shop is absorbing cost (good) or using cheaper part (danger).</li>
        <li><strong>Check the shop’s reputation:</strong> Local forums or Reddit threads show trusted vs risky shops; for example many in Lahore/Karachi mention Hafeez Centre or Techno City as hubs but also warn to be aware.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>⚠️ Common Red Flags in Pakistan’s Used/Repair Market</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>Replacement battery lasts far less than original (~1 hr vs 3–4 hrs) and seller says “that’s normal”.</li>
        <li>Screen replaced cheaply, but glare/backlight uniformity is off, or colour looks washed.</li>
        <li>Shop refuses to show or let you compare part before installation.</li>
        <li>Extremely low quote with vague part description (“generic board”, “copy battery”)</li>
        <li>No documentation of replaced part number, serial, maker.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>🎯 What we recommend if you depend on your laptop (for dev/design/remote work)</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>Prefer authorised service centres OEM (Dell, HP, Apple) where possible — parts cost more but quality is higher.</li>
        <li>If using local independent shop: treat it like an inspection: check part, test soon after, keep receipt.</li>
        <li>Regularly backup your data before repair — just in case.</li>
        <li>Consider accessories that reduce repair risk: a good external keyboard (like the OMOTON KB036 we offer at kimi.pk) can help you work even if laptop keyboard fails.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>✨ Final Thought</h3>
      <p>In Pakistan, many laptop repair shops do use genuine parts — but many do not. The phrase “original parts” is used widely, and unfortunately there’s no single guarantee across all shops. For anyone buying a used laptop or getting a repair, you must play inspector.</p>
      <p>“If your machine carries your work, make sure the part put inside it carries its genuine mark too.”</p>
