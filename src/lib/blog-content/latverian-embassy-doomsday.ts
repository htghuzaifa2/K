<h2>The Latverian Embassy: A Blink-and-Miss Shot That Signals Doomsday’s Diplomatic Chessboard</h2>
      <p>A two-second establishing shot — flag of Latveria hanging above a Manhattan brownstone, NYPD barricades below — is not just set dressing.<br>It’s the first move in Doctor Doom’s end-game: legal invasion before physical one.</p>
      <h3>🗽 Why New York, Not D.C.?</h3>
      <p>Canon precedent: The Latverian Embassy in NYC exists pre-Doom, giving him diplomatic immunity on U.S. soil.</p>
      <p>Story math: Doom doesn’t need Washington’s permission — he needs proximity to Stark Tower, Avengers Compound ruins, and the UN Headquarters — all within a 10-block radius of the leaked location.</p>
      <h3>🧨 Diplomatic Immunity = Invasion Shield</h3>
      <p>Embassy = foreign soil — FBI, NYPD, even SHIELD cannot enter without Latverian consent.</p>
      <p>Leaked call sheet: Doom’s entourage unloads a crate labeled “Arc Reactor Parts” inside the embassy — Stark tech import under diplomatic seal, immune to customs search.</p>
      <p>Historical echo: Doom once embedded a hypnotic statue inside a UN gift to force world leaders to surrender sovereignty — the embassy is the Trojan horse.</p>
      <h3>🎯 Political Stakes in One Shot</h3>
      <p>Legal Cover – Doom can stage attacks (drone swarms, energy pulses) from embassy roof and claim “sovereign act” — Avengers can’t retaliate without causing an international incident.</p>
      <p>PR Coup – Cameras show Doom arriving peacefully, shaking hands, donating relief funds — public opinion splits: “Is he really a villain?”</p>
      <p>Symbol Flip – Stars-and-Stripes backdrop replaced by Latverian gold in New York’s skyline — visual thesis: Old symbols are fragile.</p>
      <h3>🧩 Bottom Line</h3>
      <p>The embassy shot is Doom’s opening gambit:<br>“I’m not invading America — I’m renting it, legally, until you beg me to own it.”<br>Avengers will have to fight a war they can’t walk into — because the battlefield is technically not America anymore.</p>
