      <h2>The “Sharon Rogers” Theory: Decoding the Baby in Steve’s Doomsday Teaser</h2>
      <p>A single shot—Steve Rogers cradling an infant—has detonated more multiverse speculation than any quantum-rat or Darkhold cameo. Here’s why that baby is probably Sharon Rogers, and how her arrival installs a third Captain America into the MCU’s future.</p>
      <h3>🎬 What the Leaked Teaser Actually Shows</h3>
      <p>Past-timeline homestead: Steve steps off his bike, walks into a sun-lit house, strokes the old star-spangled uniform, then lifts a newborn while a piano rendition of the Avengers theme swells. On-screen text: “Steve Rogers will return in Avengers: Doomsday.” No shield, no star—just Dad energy.</p>
      <h3>🧬 Comic DNA – Who Is Sharon Rogers?</h3>
      <p>First appearance: Marvel Future Fight (2015) and Secret Wars: 1602 tie-ins. Pedigree: Daughter of Steve + Peggy in a branch timeline where Steve was never frozen.</p>
      <p>Power set:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>Inherited super-soldier traits (strength, agility, slowed aging).</li>
        <li>Star-Light Armor (hard-light shield + holo-sword) courtesy of that reality’s Tony Stark, who functions as S.H.I.E.L.D. engineer instead of billionaire playboy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Codename: Captain America — not a legacy sidekick, but field leader of the Avengers in her universe.</p>
      <h3>🌀 MCU Translation – Why the Baby Must Be Sharon</h3>
      <h4>Timeline Math</h4>
      <p>Endgame elderly-Steve already lived a full life off-screen; any child would be 80+ today—unless the baby is born inside the purified Battleworld that Doom compresses into a single timeline.</p>
      <h4>Name Drop Logic</h4>
      <p>MCU already used “Sharon Carter” (Peggy’s great-niece). Recycling “Sharon” for Steve’s daughter keeps the Peggy bloodline while avoiding “new-character exposition fatigue.”</p>
      <h4>Third Shield Holder</h4>
      <p>Sam Wilson (current Cap) + Steve’s spirit + Sharon = triple-brand Captain America for merch, Disney+ shorts, and Young Avengers leadership.</p>
      <h3>⚔️ How She Fits Doomsday & Beyond</h3>
      <p>Inciting Crisis: Steve’s decision to stay in the past fractures the Sacred Timeline; Doom exploits the splinter to justify collapsing realities into Battleworld. Raised in a Crucible: Battleworld’s “Perfected 1945 Domain” raises Sharon under Doom’s editorial eye, indoctrinating her that multiversal pruning is mercy. Third-Act Turn: Sam and Sharon duel ideologies — shield as symbol of freedom vs. shield as scalpel of order — culminating in a dual-wield finale (Sam’s wings + Sharon’s hard-light shield). Post-Credit Stinger: Teen Sharon steps through a Reed Richards rebuild portal carrying two items: Doom’s cracked mask and Steve’s original star.</p>
      <p>Tag-line: “Which America will you choose?”</p>
      <h3>🎯 Endgame (for the Arc)</h3>
      <p>Sharon Rogers becomes the MCU’s next decade Captain America — young enough for high-school Disney+ spin-offs, powered enough for Avengers ensemble, and morally gray enough to drive Civil-War-level conflict in Phase 8. One blurry baby shot = three generations of Caps, multiverse retcon, and a fresh face to carry the star after Sam’s trilogy wraps.</p>
