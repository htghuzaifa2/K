      <h2>From Iron Man to Iron Tyrant: Decoding the Meta-Genius of Robert Downey Jr. as Doctor Doom</h2>
      <h3>1. A Narrative Lightning Rod</h3>
      <p>Marvel isn’t just bringing back a beloved actor; it’s weaponizing a decade of audience affection. RDJ’s Tony Stark died in Endgame—a moment fans still treat as sacred. Re-casting him as Doctor Doom instantly weaponizes that emotional equity: every cheer, every tear, every “I love you 3000” now echoes uncomfortably behind a steel mask and monologue about multiversal order. The shock value alone guarantees Doomsday headlines before a single trailer drops.</p>
      <h3>2. The Dark Mirror Thesis</h3>
      <p>Doom and Stark are genius-billionaire-playboys who refuse to lose—but diverge at humility: Tony learned sacrifice (Snap). Doom learns control (Battleworld). RDJ playing both sides lets the MCU stage the debate on-screen: “What if the man who saved the universe decided saving wasn’t enough—and ruling was the only guarantee it stayed saved?” The wishbone photo RDJ posted (Tony & Doom snapping a turkey bone) is visual thesis: one snap saved reality, one snap will break it.</p>
      <h3>3. Meta-Narrative Shortcuts</h3>
      <p>No origin movie needed—audiences already trust RDJ’s intellect; Doom’s credibility is pre-loaded. Multiverse loophole: Marvel can swear this is “not a Tony variant” yet mine Stark iconography—same face, different soul. Comic precedent exists: Marvel Team-Up (2004) shows an alternate Stark who becomes Doom after failing to stop Thanos—a ready-made script spine.</p>
      <h3>4. Ego & Intellect Amplified</h3>
      <p>Tony’s charm was self-deprecation; Doom’s charisma is absolute conviction—RDJ gets to flip the smirk from “I’m nothing without the suit” to “I am the suit, the state, the god.” Armor evolution: Stark tech curves and glows; Doom’s iron mask is brutal, riveted, medieval—same engineer, opposite aesthetic: grace vs. tyranny.</p>
      <h3>5. Risk vs. Reward Ledger</h3>

      <h3 class="mt-4">6. The Endgame (Meta)</h3>
      <p>By fusing actor and antagonist, Marvel short-circuits the “new villain build-up” phase. RDJ’s Doom isn’t just Victor Von—he’s the ghost of Tony’s ego unleashed, a living What-If that asks: “What happens when the man who learned to die for others decides everyone else should die for him?” Answer: Iron Man becomes Iron Tyrant—and the MCU’s next saga begins with the face that started it all, turned to steel.</p>
