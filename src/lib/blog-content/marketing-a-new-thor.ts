<h2>Marketing a New Thor – Why the God of Thunder Gets His Own Doomsday Spotlight</h2>
      <p>Marvel’s 4-trailer gambit (Avatar: Fire and Ash exclusives) isn’t just a gimmick — it’s a strategic re-coronation.<br>
      Trailer #2 (Thor-centric) is engineered to do three things before a single lightning bolt hits the main trailer.</p>
      <h3>1️⃣ Re-establish Thor as a CORE Avenger</h3>
      <p>Post-Love and Thunder fatigue: comedy-heavy, mid-life crisis arc diluted his cosmic gravitas.</p>
      <p>4-week plan: Steve (nostalgia) → Thor (cosmic epic) → Doom (villain hype) → ensemble – Thor is positioned as the emotional bridge between legacy charm and multiverse stakes.</p>
      <p>Leaked beat: forest prayer scene – no jokes, no hammer twirl – just a god begging the storm for one more chance – visual reset from “party Thor” to “penitent king”.</p>
      <p>Goal: audiences leave Avatar saying “Thor’s story matters again” – before they ever see a city explode.</p>
      <h3>2️⃣ Sell Seriousness Without Spoiling Spectacle</h3>
      <p>Budget math: $200 M+ movie still 13 months out – no final VFX ready.</p>
      <p>Solution: mood-piece trailer – amber lightning, Cracked Mjolnir, single tear – stakes > splendor.</p>
      <p>Strategic silence: no release date slapped on Thor’s teaser – forces repeat viewings (“Did I miss the hammer shot?”) – free word-of-mouth loop.</p>
      <p>Marvel learns from Quantumania: show too much, hype dies – show feeling, hype compounds.</p>
      <h3>3️⃣ Merchandise & Meta-Messaging</h3>
      <p>Toy pipeline: “King Thor” (cape-less, cracked hammer) hits shelves March 2026 – trailer legitimizes the new look before Hasbro boxes leak.</p>
      <p>Meta promise: Hemsworth’s voice-over ends with “The storm returns” tagline – studio winks: “Yes, this is the Thor you’ll follow into Secret Wars” – cementing him as co-lead alongside Doom & Steve.</p>
      <h3>🎯 Bottom Line</h3>
      <p>Thor’s solo trailer isn’t fan service – it’s brand rehabilitation:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>Erase comedy fatigue</li>
        <li>Rebuild cosmic credibility</li>
        <li>Monetize cracked-hammer merch</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By the time the ensemble trailer drops, audience sentiment will already position Thor next to Stark-level icons — a god who earned one more thunderclap, not one more punchline.</p>
