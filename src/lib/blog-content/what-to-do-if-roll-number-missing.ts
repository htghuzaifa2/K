      <h2>📝 What to Do if Your Roll Number or Admit Card Is Missing Before Matric Exams</h2>
      <p>By the kimi.pk Team</p>
      <p>It’s the eve of your Matric exams in Pakistan, and suddenly — panic! Your roll number slip or admit card is nowhere to be found. Don’t worry; this happens to many students, and the solution is simpler than you think. Here’s a step-by-step guide to get you back on track.</p>
      
      <h3>🔹 Step 1: Stay Calm & Double-Check</h3>
      <p>Look through your school records, emails, and any official board portals.</p>
      <p>Sometimes boards (Punjab, Sindh, KPK, Balochistan, FBISE) upload digital copies online, which can be downloaded instantly.</p>
      
      <h3>🔹 Step 2: Contact Your School Immediately</h3>
      <p>Your school administration is the first point of contact.</p>
      <p>Provide your full name, class, roll number (if known), and CNIC/B-Form number.</p>
      <p>Schools can request a duplicate admit card from the board.</p>
      
      <h3>🔹 Step 3: Contact the Board Directly</h3>
      <p>If your school can’t help immediately, call or email the respective board:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>FBISE: fbise.edu.pk</li>
        <li>BISE Lahore / Karachi / Peshawar / Quetta: Check official websites</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some boards allow walk-in applications for duplicate admit cards, usually with a small fee.</p>
      
      <h3>🔹 Step 4: Submit Required Documents</h3>
      <p>Typically boards ask for:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>Written request</li>
        <li>CNIC/B-form copy</li>
        <li>Recent passport-size photo</li>
        <li>Fee receipt (if any)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tip: Submit digitally if your board accepts PDFs to save time.</p>
      
      <h3>🔹 Step 5: Follow Deadlines Closely</h3>
      <p>Duplicate admit cards often take 1–3 days.</p>
      <p>Don’t wait until the last day — missing your admit card can prevent you from entering the exam hall.</p>
      
      <h3>💡 Bonus Productivity Tip for Students in Pakistan</h3>
      <p>Managing forms, downloading PDFs, and keeping track of documents can be hectic. A reliable wireless keyboard can save time and reduce mistakes. We recommend the <a href="/products/omoton-kb036-wireless-bluetooth-keyboard">OMOTON KB036 Bluetooth Keyboard</a> — silent scissor-switch keys, long battery life, and fully compatible with Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS.

      <h3>✅ Quick Checklist</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li>Check digital copies online first.</li>
        <li>Contact your school administration immediately.</li>
        <li>Reach out to the board directly if needed.</li>
        <li>Prepare documents & fee for duplicate application.</li>
        <li>Submit well before deadlines to avoid panic.</li>
        <li>Use a keyboard for smooth typing and document management.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>🌟 Final Thought</h3>
      <p>Losing your roll number slip is stressful, but with the right steps and a little organization, you can stay calm and get back on track.</p>
